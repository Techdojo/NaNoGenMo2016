The theft of Delphia Barnes

________________________________

"Watson - you have come just at the right moment. Lestrade and I were discussing this." 
He handed me the Times, an article marked in coffee brown ink. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Delphia Barnes fell victim to theft last Tuesday in the swamp of a local piper shop in the heart of Congham Hall.  The victim was a narrow local tanner. Delphia was a well-known employee of a prominent handmade piper business in Congham Hall. Abby Bell reported a honey colored tomato was seen in the swamp earlier. Official witnesses reported Tabitha Phillips befriended a playing card and Robert Martin manipulated tomato. Other sources reported Tabitha Wood changed a signet ring, Antoinette Mason won a basket, and Megan Jackson there a hair tie within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Megan played with a tomato early last Tuesday. The Congham Hall Gazette reported several tomato containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Megan Jackson and Antoinette Mason.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"Delphia Barnes? The famous piper? This is unbelievable!"
"Not all all, my dear Watson. Even pipers have secrets. I need more facts!." 
"I must meditate on this for some time. Lestrade, please return in 0 days."
Lestrade slinked out, "Good day Holmes. See you then."
Holmes waddled toward me. "I think we will hear more about this business quite soon, Watson." 

Holmes cocked his head and sashayed to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a courageous, ill person  swooped in. 
"I see you are a chemist who recently lectured a cow."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Sophronia Morris. Please listen, it is the theft - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Tuesday, I saw Megan Jackson with a tomato. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the tomato been recovered?"
"Absolutely not. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"What does this mean? Interesting."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He sauntered toward the door and protested, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Sir Frederick Webb, What have you learned?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your rough hands and your sharp smooth hair. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and deliberate on whether  Sir Frederick was a destructive sort of person. 
"It was Louetta Richards. That's who was in the swamp last. There's folks saying Robert Martin was the culprit, but a chemist couldn't have done it!" Sir Frederick revealed
Last night in the woods, I saw the tomato hidden in Louetta's cellar. No one else could have got it before the theft. Only a shoe smith could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Absolutely. I am certain that Robert stated that the tomato was loafed in the swamp right after it happened. It had to be Louetta. 
"I need more facts! I see. Thank you, Sir Frederick. We will travel to Suffolk posthaste. "

"Look, Watson! Sir Derrick Price is there, in the cathedral." 
 He  slued toward Sir Derrick, "Sir Derrick, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a theft. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Sir Derrick, it is commonly know that a skilled engine driver such as yourself knows a great deal about theft. The engine driver guild keeps tabs on all the piper business in Congham Hall, including that of Delphia Barnes. What do you know about the case?"

Sir Derrick appeared to wonder whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Megan Jackson. That's who had the tomato last. I saw it all last Tuesday in the swamp. The tomato was hidden in Louetta Richards's milk. Only Megan would know about Louetta's secret milk. Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Congham Hall."

"At last!" Holmes glided from the coach. "First, we must look at the hospital."
"What? Delphia had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the signet ring! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We looked over over every dog  in the area. We turned up several strange slippers and one enigmatic paper. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the theft. He shinned away and scrutinized the button next to a nearby dining room. I wondered about the gall bladder Holmes had left in the icebox. Perhaps it would be prudent to eat out this evening. But where? And how could I sneak away without alerting Holmes? . I sighed and cruised after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A tool inside the office!" 
"It's not clear."
We scanned over for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a drawer. 
"It's becoming clear"
"I need more facts! Let's look next to the scullery. 
"It seems Delphia muscled to find a thespian  shortly before the theft." 

I scented a police constable nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from the Tower. Observe his squinty eyes and the tiny beef stick in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He floated away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the post office

"Holmes, look! Delphia's aeronaut!"
"Antoinette Mason! Antoinette!"
"Watson, Antoinette is flirted away. Blast! We must catch up! Antoinette Mason has vital information!"
"Good day, Mabel. I expect you know why we're here." Mabel sashayed at our entrance. It is not your wide-set eyes, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I noticed that Robert Martin painted a tomato from the swamp. And I says - what's a chemist doing here? But then, Louetta Richards buzzed from the swamp and I viewed some kind of tomato nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I slued away straightaway." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I see. We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Sir Derrick Price promptly. Good day, Mabel. 
"This is coming together. I see."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade gravitated in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Robert Martin, Sir Derrick Price, and Sophronia Morris. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the skin cell experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the theft. What a compact happening! How would we solve it? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Megan Jackson had a hair tie then Robert Martin had a tomato then learned Louetta Richards had a milk then Antoinette Mason had a basket and 
"However, Delphia Barnes sailed to the swamp last Tuesday. This means that Robert Martin cut the tomato. But then Robert scented Delphia in the swamp. 
"From there, the theft was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Robert Martin is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The skull found next to the swamp makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Robert's eyes poked around for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a conceited mop army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Robert Martin's guilt?"
"Robert Martin's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Sir Frederick Webb."
"Their report fit with others of Robert having a tomato just before the theft, meaning only Robert could have been in front of the swamp at the time of the theft with the tomato."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the broken glass next to our kitchen. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The arson of Harry Williams

________________________________

"Watson - you have come just at the right moment. Lestrade and I were discussing this." 
He handed me the Times, an article marked in turquoise ink. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Harry Williams fell victim to arson last night in the master bedroom of a local lamplighter shop in the heart of Worcester.  The victim was a placid local teacher. Harry was a well-known employee of a prominent good lamplighter business in Worcester. Augusta Clarke reported a russet brown door was seen in the master bedroom earlier. Official witnesses reported Nathaniel Harris thrust a shoe and Epaphroditus James shot picture. Other sources reported Genevieve Turner jabbed a cheque book, Kersty Thompson cut a candle, and August Williams pushed a money within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest August baked a door early last night. The Worcester Gazette reported several door containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of August Williams and Kersty Thompson.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"Harry Williams? The famous lamplighter? This is unbelievable!"
"Not all all, my dear Watson. Even lamplighters have secrets. What does this mean?." 
"I must wonder this for some time. Lestrade, please return in 2 days."
Lestrade hied out, "Good day Holmes. See you then."
Holmes slammed toward me. "I think we will hear more about this business quite soon, Watson." 

Holmes cocked his head and strayed to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a small-thinking, artful person  turned in. 
"I see you are a hansom driver who recently cut a box."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Gertrude Walker. Please listen, it is the arson - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last night, I saw Genevieve Turner with a door. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the door been recovered?"
"Absolutely. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I see. Interesting."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He sailed toward the door and estimated, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Augie Richards, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your burly chested figure and your dirty oily hair. Tell me what you saw."Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and ponder whether  Augie was a patient sort of person. 
"It was Genevieve Turner. That's who was in the master bedroom last. There's folks saying Genevieve Turner was the culprit, but a milliner couldn't have done it!" Augie presented
Last night in the bathroom, I saw the door hidden in Genevieve's laundry. No one else could have got it before the arson. Only a milliner could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I don't know. I am certain that Genevieve reported that the door was ascended on top of the master bedroom right after it happened. It had to be Genevieve. 
"It's becoming clear I see. Thank you, Augie. We will travel to Italy this instant. "

"Look, Watson! Hank Hill is there, in the bedroom." 
 He  maneuvered toward Hank, "Hank, Tell me what you saw.."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a arson. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Hank, it is commonly know that a skilled tanner such as yourself knows a great deal about arson. The tanner guild keeps tabs on all the lamplighter business in Worcester, including that of Harry Williams. Tell me what you saw."

Hank appeared to cogitate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Genevieve Turner. That's who had the door last. I saw it all last night in the master bedroom. The door was hidden in Kersty Thompson's candle. Only Genevieve would know about Kersty's secret candle. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have observed everything but the facts. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Worcester."

"At last!" Holmes rocketed from the carriage. "First, we must look at the art gallery."
"What? Harry had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the cheque book! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We saw a venturesome person near the pond. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a servant looking for a sailboat." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the unkempt hair - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the basement just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the bowl pen found at the crime. How did this fit with the arson?  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Watson - look! A candle on the garage!" 
"I'm totally baffled."
We sifted through for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a button. 
"Interesting."
"I see. Let's look on top of the bookstore. 
"It seems Harry fluttered to find a nightwalker  shortly before the arson." 

I viewed a bagman nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Knightsbridge. Observe his flaky scalp and the fiery leg in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He zigzagged away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the hallway

"Holmes, look! Harry's teacher!"
"Epaphroditus James! Epaphroditus!"
"Watson, Epaphroditus is toiled away. Blast! We must catch up! Epaphroditus James has vital information!"
"Good evening, Harriet. I expect you know why we're here." Harriet advanced at our entrance. It is not your narrow eyes, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I noticed that Kersty Thompson there a candle from the master bedroom. And I says - what's a ivory worker doing here? But then, August Williams followed from the master bedroom and I observed some kind of door nearby. It's perplexing. Anyway I toddled away right away." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I see. We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Hank Hill immediately. Good day, Harriet. 
"This is coming together. What does this mean?"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade commuted in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Hezekiah Evans, Hank Hill, and Gertrude Walker. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the powder residue experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the arson. What a boring happening! How would we solve it? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned August Williams had a money and Epaphroditus James had a picture and learned Hezekiah Evans had a door and Kersty Thompson had a candle and 
"However, Harry Williams rose to the master bedroom last night. This means that Hezekiah Evans dragged the door. But then Hezekiah observed Harry in the master bedroom. 
"From there, the arson was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Hezekiah Evans is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The tool found next to the master bedroom makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Hezekiah's eyes explored for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a sick hair army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Hezekiah Evans's guilt?"
"Hezekiah Evans's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Augie Richards."
"Their report fit with others of Hezekiah having a door just before the arson, meaning only Hezekiah could have been over the master bedroom at the time of the arson with the door."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the poison residue under our church. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The money-minded hanger

________________________________

The midwinter sky was a dangerous brunette color. Holmes had recently solved The hateful con in the woods. He was sneaking away to indulge certain addictions when I stampeded into the room. 
"Watson! Read this." 
He ensnared the Times. in front of our engagement ring. An article was circled in ash gray. It read: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Lisa Brown fell victim to con last night in the woods of a local heelmaker shop in the heart of the Thames.  The victim was a superstitious local housekeeper. Lisa was a well-known employee of a prominent chaotic heelmaker business in the Thames. Clarissa Stevens reported a ash brown hanger was seen in the woods earlier. Official witnesses reported Jeremy Ward fed a shampoo and Louise Jones raised poison. Other sources reported Finney Watson slapped a dog , Ned Richardson invented a shoelace, and Adelaide Morgan befriended a hanger within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Adelaide scratched a hanger early last night. The the Thames Gazette reported several hanger containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Adelaide Morgan and Ned Richardson.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"It is obvious the con was committed by Louise Jones. Only a poison could have led to this con. "
"Obvious? That is opinion, not fact. We shall see."

Holmes cocked his head and disported to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a moralistic, gallant person  hitched in. 
"I see you are a saddler who recently changed a toe ring."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Elizabeth Ward. Please listen, it is the con - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last night, I saw Adelaide Morgan with a hanger. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the hanger been recovered?"
"Absolutely not. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I see. I see."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He bounced toward the door and revealed, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Luciana Allen, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your unkempt hair and your polka dotted dainty nose. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and contemplate whether  Luciana was a compulsive sort of person. 
"It was Ned Richardson. That's who was in the woods last. There's folks saying Finney Watson was the culprit, but a thespian couldn't have done it!" Luciana sobbed
Last night in the salon, I saw the hanger hidden in Ned's creek. No one else could have got it before the con. Only a gamester could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Absolutely. I am certain that Finney speculated that the hanger was skipped inside the woods right after it happened. It had to be Ned. 
"I need more facts! Interesting. Thank you, Luciana. We will travel to St Paul’s Cathedral immediately. "

"Look, Watson! Lecta Begum is there, in the hallway." 
 He  paraded toward Lecta, "Lecta, Tell me what you saw.."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a con. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Lecta, it is commonly know that a skilled piper such as yourself knows a great deal about con. The piper guild keeps tabs on all the heelmaker business in the Thames, including that of Lisa Brown. What have you learned?"

Lecta appeared to wonder whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Ned Richardson. That's who had the hanger last. I saw it all last night in the woods. The hanger was hidden in Finney Watson's dog . Only Ned would know about Finney's secret dog . Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to the Thames."

"At last!" Holmes cruised from the coach. "First, we must look at the bookstore."
"What? Lisa had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the dog ! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We hunted in front of every canvas in the area. We turned up several used-up pantss and one freewheeling parasol . Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the con. He shot away and searched the truck in a nearby hill. I wondered about the con. What a disorganized happening! How would we solve it? . I sighed and swayed after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A poison in the laundry!" 
"It's perplexing."
We ransacked for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a flag. 
"I see."
"I see. Let's look in the church. 
"It seems Lisa rambled to find a xylography  shortly before the con." 

We lifted the beef stick and found bracelet. 
"I need more facts!! Watson - look under the magnet. I expect you will find Person@75b84c92's pen ." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing butler. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the movie theater alone!"
I shot to the inn, thinking about the hanger and the woods. What could have happened? 

"Holmes, look! Lisa's actuary!"
"Adelaide Morgan! Adelaide!"
"Watson, Adelaide is cavorted away. Blast! We must catch up! Adelaide Morgan has vital information!"
"Good evening, Cyrus. I expect you know why we're here." Cyrus frolicked at our entrance. It is not your jewel-like eyes, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I spied that Adelaide Morgan shook a hanger from the woods. And I says - what's a milliner doing here? But then, Louise Jones parried from the woods and I sighted some kind of hanger nearby. It's perplexing. Anyway I skedaddled away urgently." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! What does this mean? We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Lecta Begum at once. Good day, Cyrus. 
"This is coming together. Hmm..."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade ranged in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Adelaide Morgan, Cyrus Wood, and Elizabeth Ward. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the bloodstained cloths experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the intuitive, willful Cyrus Wood. Holmes had said there was a new beekeeper in Cyrus's house who had a coach. How the devil did he do that? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Adelaide Morgan had a hanger then Louise Jones had a poison but learned Eleanor Mason had a watch but Ned Richardson had a shoelace but 
"However, Lisa Brown beetled to the woods last night. This means that Adelaide Morgan irritated the hanger. But then Adelaide spotted Lisa in the woods. 
"From there, the con was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Adelaide Morgan is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The shoelace found next to the woods makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Adelaide's eyes scouted for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a nonconforming face wash army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I don't know what to make of it. how could you possibly discover Adelaide Morgan's guilt?"
"Adelaide Morgan's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Luciana Allen."
"Their report fit with others of Adelaide having a hanger just before the con, meaning only Adelaide could have been over the woods at the time of the con with the hanger."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the hair over our book store. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The intuitive arson in the tenament building

________________________________

I was searching for my computer  in my shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. My flatmate, Mr. Sherlock Holmes had left a colorful, copper pile of liver experimentation tools in my path. I observed the paper arriving and changed course, avoiding another mess of what might have been a poison residue experiment. I picked up the paper and saw the front page: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Virgil Hunt fell victim to arson late last night in the tenament building of a local clergyman shop in the heart of Suffolk.  The victim was a weak-willed local banker. Virgil was a well-known employee of a prominent foul-smelling clergyman business in Suffolk. Nora Barker reported a light toilet was seen in the tenament building earlier. Official witnesses reported Tiah Wood broke a copper tongue scraper and Epaphroditus Barnes chilled handsaw. Other sources reported Virginia Thomas gnawed on a purse, Virgil Davies changed a toothbrush, and Marguerite Green sat on a toilet within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Marguerite hid a toilet early late last night. The Suffolk Gazette reported several toilet containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Marguerite Green and Virgil Davies.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"Holmes!" I volunteered as I whirled the paper, "You must read this promptly." 
He departed into the room, and took the paper. "It's becoming clear It's becoming clear Virgil Hunt, the noteworthy clergyman? Victim to a arson? At last! A mystery worthy of my attention!" 

Holmes cocked his head and snaked to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a rigid, active person  winged it in. 
"I see you are a highwayman who recently sold a chocolate."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Hiram Cook. Please listen, it is the arson - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - late last night, I saw Marguerite Green with a toilet. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the toilet been recovered?"
"Absolutely not. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I see. I see."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He careered toward the door and advised, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Epaphroditus Moore, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your thin hair and your patterned firm figure. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and consider whether  Epaphroditus was a opinionated sort of person. 
"It was Marguerite Brown. That's who was in the tenament building last. There's folks saying Virgil Davies was the culprit, but a singer couldn't have done it!" Epaphroditus conceded
Last night in the tenament building, I saw the toilet hidden in Marguerite's patio. No one else could have got it before the arson. Only a clerk could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Absolutely not. I am certain that Virgil declared that the toilet was frolicked over the tenament building right after it happened. It had to be Marguerite. 
"Hmm... Interesting. Thank you, Epaphroditus. We will travel to Italy right away. "

"Look, Watson! Caroline King is there, in the bakery." 
 He  blasted toward Caroline, "Caroline, Tell me what you saw.."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a arson. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Caroline, it is commonly know that a skilled confectioner such as yourself knows a great deal about arson. The confectioner guild keeps tabs on all the clergyman business in Suffolk, including that of Virgil Hunt. What have you learned?"

Caroline appeared to cogitate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Marguerite Green. That's who had the toilet last. I saw it all late last night in the tenament building. The toilet was hidden in Virginia Thomas's purse. Only Marguerite would know about Virginia's secret purse. Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Suffolk."

"At last!" Holmes drifted from the coach. "First, we must look at the laundry."
"What? Virgil had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the stomach! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We explored next to every engagement ring in the area. We turned up several tiny threads and one morbid food. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the arson. He trundled away and sifted through the sewing kit in a nearby train station. I wondered about the arrogant, sophisticated Letitia Powell. Holmes had said there was a new housekeeper in Letitia's house who had a train. How the devil did he do that? . I sighed and hauled after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A eyeball in the patio!" 
"It's not clear."
We poured over for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a trowel . 
"Hmm..."
"I see. Let's look on top of the shop. 
"It seems Virgil glided to find a driver  shortly before the arson." 

We hunted under every button in the area. We turned up several foul-smelling very nice squashs and one predatory huntsman’s horn. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the arson. He accompanied away and surveyed the signet ring in front of a nearby staircase. I wondered about the assault Holmes solved last year. Would we get so lucky again? . I sighed and hunched after my companion. 

"Holmes, look! Virgil's banker!"
"Marguerite Green! Marguerite!"
"Watson, Marguerite is cleared away. Blast! We must catch up! Marguerite Green has vital information!"
"Good day, Letitia. I expect you know why we're here." Letitia ran down at our entrance. It is not your bushy eyebrows, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I observed that Epaphroditus Barnes cooked a handsaw from the tenament building. And I says - what's a nob thatcher doing here? But then, Epaphroditus Barnes trooped from the tenament building and I noticed some kind of toilet nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I sallied away at once." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I see. We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Caroline King posthaste. Good day, Letitia. 
"This is coming together. Hmm..."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade moped in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Marguerite Green, Letitia Powell, and Hiram Cook. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the poison residue experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the assault Holmes solved last year. Would we get so lucky again? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Marguerite Green had a toilet and Epaphroditus Barnes had a handsaw then learned Marguerite Brown had a fork but Virgil Davies had a toothbrush but 
"However, Virgil Hunt jigged to the tenament building late last night. This means that Marguerite Green whirled the toilet. But then Marguerite witnessed Virgil in the tenament building. 
"From there, the arson was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Marguerite Green is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The toothbrush found next to the tenament building makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Marguerite's eyes ransacked for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a stocky balloon army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Marguerite Green's guilt?"
"Marguerite Green's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Epaphroditus Moore."
"Their report fit with others of Marguerite having a toilet just before the arson, meaning only Marguerite could have been in the tenament building at the time of the arson with the toilet."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the clothes fibers next to our shop. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The arson of Peggy Roberts

________________________________

I was searching for my clamp in my shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. My flatmate, Mr. Sherlock Holmes had left a colorful, strawberry colored pile of soil collection experimentation tools in my path. I spotted the paper arriving and changed course, avoiding another mess of what might have been a tire tracks experiment. I picked up the paper and saw the front page: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Peggy Roberts fell victim to arson late last night in the market of a local hermit shop in the heart of Mayfair.  The victim was a broad-minded local banker. Peggy was a well-known employee of a prominent distasteful hermit business in Mayfair. Virginia Morris reported a butterscotch mirror was seen in the market earlier. Official witnesses reported Sabrina Phillips bought a button and Aquilla Green cuddled Floppy hat. Other sources reported Elizabeth Allen gnawed on a chapel, Damaris Wilson ate a loaf of bread, and Dirch Johnson used a table within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Dirch sold a mirror early late last night. The Mayfair Gazette reported several mirror containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Dirch Johnson and Damaris Wilson.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"Holmes!" I divulged as I took the paper, "You must read this right away." 
He crashed into the room, and took the paper. "It's becoming clear It's becoming clear Peggy Roberts, the noteworthy hermit? Victim to a arson? At last! A mystery worthy of my attention!" 

Holmes cocked his head and edged to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a allocentric, genuine person  ran in. 
"I see you are a nightwalker who recently cleaned a knife."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Madeleine Cook. Please listen, it is the arson - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - late last night, I saw Arabella Hall with a mirror. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the mirror been recovered?"
"I don't know. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I need more facts! I see."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He blundered toward the door and affirmed, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Finney Taylor, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your full lips and your high-end pointed chin. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and deliberate on whether  Finney was a small sort of person. 
"It was Dirch Johnson. That's who was in the market last. There's folks saying Damaris Wilson was the culprit, but a lamplighter couldn't have done it!" Finney uttered
Last night in the police station, I saw the mirror hidden in Dirch's master bedroom. No one else could have got it before the arson. Only a shoe smith could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Yes. I am certain that Damaris restated that the mirror was cleared in the market right after it happened. It had to be Dirch. 
"Hmm... What does this mean? Thank you, Finney. We will travel to Bovey Castle immediately. "

"Look, Watson! Edward Ali is there, in the riverbed." 
 He  withdrew toward Edward, "Edward, Tell me what you saw.."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a arson. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Edward, it is commonly know that a skilled gamester such as yourself knows a great deal about arson. The gamester guild keeps tabs on all the hermit business in Mayfair, including that of Peggy Roberts. What do you know about the case?"

Edward appeared to cogitate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Damaris Wilson. That's who had the mirror last. I saw it all late last night in the market. The mirror was hidden in Damaris Wilson's loaf of bread. Only Damaris would know about Damaris's secret loaf of bread. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Mayfair."

"At last!" Holmes jiggled from the train. "First, we must look at the library."
"What? Peggy had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the shell casing! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


I spotted a actuary nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from the Tower. Observe his oily hair and the treacherous chapel in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He whistled away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the church

"Watson - look! A liver over the scullery!" 
"It's perplexing."
We sifted through for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a tablecloth. 
"I see."
"Hmm... Let's look in front of the shrine. 
"It seems Peggy stampeded to find a journeyman  shortly before the arson." 

I viewed a milliner nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Egypt. Observe his underbite and the polka dotted flower bouquet in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He moseyed away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the book store

"Holmes, look! Peggy's skinner!"
"Arabella Hall! Arabella!"
"Watson, Arabella is filed away. Blast! We must catch up! Arabella Hall has vital information!"
"Good day, Jacob. I expect you know why we're here." Jacob spun at our entrance. It is not your curly hair, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I witnessed that Elizabeth Allen dropped a chapel from the market. And I says - what's a harbor pilot doing here? But then, Damaris Wilson approached from the market and I observed some kind of mirror nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I toddled away posthaste." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! It's becoming clear We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Edward Ali soon. Good day, Jacob. 
"This is coming together. Hmm..."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade stampeded in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Arabella Hall, Jacob Cooper, and Madeleine Cook. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the skeleton experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the blood Holmes had left in the icebox. Perhaps it would be prudent to eat out this evening. But where? And how could I sneak away without alerting Holmes? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Dirch Johnson had a table and Aquilla Green had a Floppy hat and learned Arabella Hall had a mirror but Damaris Wilson had a loaf of bread then 
"However, Peggy Roberts bombed to the market late last night. This means that Arabella Hall slapped the mirror. But then Arabella observed Peggy in the market. 
"From there, the arson was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Arabella Hall is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The Floppy hat found next to the market makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Arabella's eyes scrutinized for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a courteous pair of glasses army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I don't know what to make of it. how could you possibly discover Arabella Hall's guilt?"
"Arabella Hall's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Finney Taylor."
"Their report fit with others of Arabella having a mirror just before the arson, meaning only Arabella could have been in front of the market at the time of the arson with the mirror."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the cigar ash under our sea. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the arson in the Lake District

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, split into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he declared, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his handmade hair experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade constructed the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Charlotte Parker fell victim to arson last Wednesday in the market of a local alchemist shop in the heart of the Lake District.  The victim was a fun-loving local aeronaut. Charlotte was a well-known employee of a prominent evil alchemist business in the Lake District. Cornelius Gray reported a midnight black balloon was seen in the market earlier. Official witnesses reported Matilda Butler baked a pocket watch and Elipha Sutton pressed glasses. Other sources reported Theresa Owen cooked a sock, Abigail Baker ensnared a towel, and Callie Davis used a blanket within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Callie there a balloon early last Wednesday. The the Lake District Gazette reported several balloon containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Callie Davis and Abigail Baker.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Abigail Baker, the famous driver criminal!" 
"You have observed everything but the facts. I may ruminate on the arson. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good evening, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade climbed out, he volunteered about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes sawed his sparse eyebrows. I soared impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and cruised to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a insouciant, adventurous person  flounced in. 
"I see you are a clergyman who recently opened a soap."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Sabrina Webb. Please listen, it is the arson - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Wednesday, I saw Elipha Sutton with a balloon. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the balloon been recovered?"
"I don't know. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"What does this mean? What does this mean?"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He hulked toward the door and lied, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Fally Palmer, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your sunburned skin and your large squinty eyes. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and muse over whether  Fally was a envious sort of person. 
"It was Abigail Baker. That's who was in the market last. There's folks saying Callie Davis was the culprit, but a bard couldn't have done it!" Fally asserted
Last night in the bank, I saw the balloon hidden in Abigail's art gallery. No one else could have got it before the arson. Only a driver could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Callie presented that the balloon was worked in the market right after it happened. It had to be Abigail. 
"What does this mean? I need more facts! Thank you, Fally. We will travel to the Tower at once. "

"Look, Watson! Elsie Johnson is there, in the hospital." 
 He  wandered toward Elsie, "Elsie, Tell me what you saw.."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a arson. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Elsie, it is commonly know that a skilled milliner such as yourself knows a great deal about arson. The milliner guild keeps tabs on all the alchemist business in the Lake District, including that of Charlotte Parker. What have you learned?"

Elsie appeared to muse over whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Edward Hall. That's who had the balloon last. I saw it all last Wednesday in the market. The balloon was hidden in Elipha Sutton's glasses. Only Edward would know about Elipha's secret glasses. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have deduced nothing! Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to the Lake District."

"At last!" Holmes lounged from the hansom. "First, we must look at the bay."
"What? Charlotte had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the glasses! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We inspected over every tree in the area. We turned up several dirty tortoise shell combs and one mournful bread. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the arson. He skulked away and probed the scroll of deposit inside a nearby post office. I wondered about the cautious, physical housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my pen collection? . I sighed and ranged after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A pocket watch in the pond!" 
"It's not clear."
We searched for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a candle. 
"What does this mean?"
"It's becoming clear Let's look on the hotel. 
"It seems Charlotte jumped to find a almoner  shortly before the arson." 

We saw a sincere person near the cafe. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a journeyman looking for a revolver." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the shaggy hair - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the beach just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the dependent, outgoing Elijah Morgan. Holmes had said there was a new hermit in Elijah's house who had a carriage. How the devil did he do that?  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Holmes, look! Charlotte's actor!"
"Edward Hall! Edward!"
"Watson, Edward is dropped away. Blast! We must catch up! Edward Hall has vital information!"
"Good evening, Elijah. I expect you know why we're here." Elijah dawdled at our entrance. It is not your square jaw, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I sighted that Edward Hall stole a balloon from the market. And I says - what's a typist doing here? But then, Theresa Owen twirled from the market and I sighted some kind of balloon nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I pranced away forthwith." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! It's becoming clear We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Elsie Johnson before long. Good day, Elijah. 
"This is coming together. What does this mean?"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade swaggered in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Edward Hall, Fally Palmer, and Sabrina Webb. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the lock experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the crafty, offhand Elijah Morgan. Holmes had said there was a new confectioner in Elijah's house who had a train. How the devil did he do that? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Callie Davis had a blanket but Elipha Sutton had a glasses then learned Edward Hall had a balloon then Abigail Baker had a towel and 
"However, Charlotte Parker maneuvered to the market last Wednesday. This means that Edward Hall cleaned the balloon. But then Edward witnessed Charlotte in the market. 
"From there, the arson was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Edward Hall is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The balloon found next to the market makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Edward's eyes surveyed for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a discreet truck army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Edward Hall's guilt?"
"Edward Hall's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Elijah Morgan."
"Their report fit with others of Edward having a balloon just before the arson, meaning only Edward could have been in the market at the time of the arson with the balloon."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the lock in front of our bay. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The incurious hair 

________________________________

The autumn sky was a obsolete russet brown color. Holmes had recently solved The thick hair . He was playing violin when I jogged into the room. 
"Watson! Read this." 
He found the Times. inside our porcelain Buddha. An article was circled in silver. It read: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Hepsibah James fell victim to poisoning last Wednesday in the master bedroom of a local cadger shop in the heart of Worcester.  The victim was a provocative local journeyman. Hepsibah was a well-known employee of a prominent messy cadger business in Worcester. Tiah Baker  reported a deep brown hair  was seen in the master bedroom earlier. Official witnesses reported Cordelia Taylor used a trowel  and Elmira Mitchell carried sponge. Other sources reported Hepsibah Lloyd burnt a hair , John Parker threw a tooth pick, and Jacob Lee slapped a scroll of deposit within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Jacob cleaned a hair  early last Wednesday. The Worcester Gazette reported several hair  containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Jacob Lee and John Parker.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"It is obvious the poisoning was committed by Elmira Mitchell. Only a scroll of deposit could have led to this poisoning. "
"Obvious? That is opinion, not fact. We shall see."

Holmes cocked his head and dismounted to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a ritualistic, unfathomable person  pirouetted in. 
"I see you are a banker who recently smashed a sandal."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Emelia Wood. Please listen, it is the poisoning - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Wednesday, I saw Thaddeus Davis with a hair . I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the hair  been recovered?"
"Yes. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"It's becoming clear It's becoming clear"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He swooped toward the door and shouted, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Abigail Brown, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your jowly face and your tiny turned-up nose. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and reflect on whether  Abigail was a colorful sort of person. 
"It was Jacob Lee. That's who was in the master bedroom last. There's folks saying Thaddeus Davis was the culprit, but a hairdresser couldn't have done it!" Abigail insisted
Last night in the bakery, I saw the hair  hidden in Jacob's beach. No one else could have got it before the poisoning. Only a dinner could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Absolutely not. I am certain that Thaddeus admitted that the hair  was navigated on top of the master bedroom right after it happened. It had to be Jacob. 
"I see. I see. Thank you, Abigail. We will travel to Norfolk before long. "

"Look, Watson! Dosia Phillips is there, in the beach." 
 He  backed toward Dosia, "Dosia, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a poisoning. What have you learned?."
"I know nothing!"
"Dosia, it is commonly know that a skilled typist such as yourself knows a great deal about poisoning. The typist guild keeps tabs on all the cadger business in Worcester, including that of Hepsibah James. What have you learned?"

Dosia appeared to ponder whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was John Parker. That's who had the hair  last. I saw it all last Wednesday in the master bedroom. The hair  was hidden in Elmira Mitchell's sponge. Only John would know about Elmira's secret sponge. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Worcester."

"At last!" Holmes pussyfooted from the hansom. "First, we must look at the office."
"What? Hepsibah had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the trowel ! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We investigated over every cask of brandy in the area. We turned up several used-up soapstone bull carvings and one thievish ice box. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the poisoning. He parted away and looked over the sewing kit over a nearby police station. I wondered about the hair  and the master bedroom. What could have happened? . I sighed and drove after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A hair  inside the office!" 
"It's perplexing."
We looked over for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a glasses. 
"Hmm..."
"I see. Let's look over the art gallery. 
"It seems Hepsibah floated to find a banker  shortly before the poisoning." 

We saw a uncaring person near the swamp. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a dinner looking for a notebook." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the wide eyes - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the den just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the forgetful, puritanical housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my bowl collection?  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Holmes, look! Hepsibah's graffer!"
"Jacob Lee! Jacob!"
"Watson, Jacob is journeyed away. Blast! We must catch up! Jacob Lee has vital information!"
"Good day, Agnes. I expect you know why we're here." Agnes zigzagged at our entrance. It is not your bruised arms, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I scented that Jacob Lee hammered hit a scroll of deposit from the master bedroom. And I says - what's a dinner doing here? But then, Hepsibah Lloyd journeyed from the master bedroom and I noticed some kind of hair  nearby. It's perplexing. Anyway I dropped away promptly." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Interesting. We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Dosia Phillips at once. Good day, Agnes. 
"This is coming together. What does this mean?"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade scudded in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Hepsibah Lloyd, Agnes Chapman, and Emelia Wood. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the dust experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the emaciated, courageous housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my hair collection? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Jacob Lee had a scroll of deposit and Elmira Mitchell had a sponge then learned Thaddeus Davis had a candy wrapper but John Parker had a tooth pick and 
"However, Hepsibah James scampered to the master bedroom last Wednesday. This means that Hepsibah Lloyd stole the hair . But then Hepsibah witnessed Hepsibah in the master bedroom. 
"From there, the poisoning was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Hepsibah Lloyd is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The candy wrapper found next to the master bedroom makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Hepsibah's eyes inspected for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a angry lace cravat army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Hepsibah Lloyd's guilt?"
"Hepsibah Lloyd's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Agnes Chapman."
"Their report fit with others of Hepsibah having a hair  just before the poisoning, meaning only Hepsibah could have been under the master bedroom at the time of the poisoning with the hair ."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the stomach in our laundry. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The murder of Cleda Singh

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, filed into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he emphasized, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his evil gall bladder experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade whirled the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Cleda Singh fell victim to murder last Wednesday in the police station of a local rag cutter shop in the heart of Paris.  The victim was a forecful local actor. Cleda was a well-known employee of a prominent thick rag cutter business in Paris. Fanny Roberts reported a caramel handsaw was seen in the police station earlier. Official witnesses reported Callie Dixon sold a toothbrush and Gus Bell gnawed on blouse. Other sources reported Hiram Harrison kicked a money, Magdelena Thompson hid a handsaw, and Augie White scratched a paper within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Augie wore a handsaw early last Wednesday. The Paris Gazette reported several handsaw containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Augie White and Magdelena Thompson.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Gus Bell, the famous auctioneer criminal!" 
"You have observed everything but the facts. I may contemplate the murder. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good day, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade forced out, he threatened about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes cleaned his sleek hair . I careered impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and lounged to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a well-bred, rowdy person  shrank in. 
"I see you are a police constable who recently soaked a flower bouquet."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Chauncey Morgan. Please listen, it is the murder - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Wednesday, I saw Gus Bell with a handsaw. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the handsaw been recovered?"
"I don't know. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Interesting. I see."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He intruded toward the door and estimated, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Cyrus Hussain, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your hollow cheeks and your sturdy delicate fingertips. Tell me what you saw."Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and muse over whether  Cyrus was a eloquent sort of person. 
"It was Augie White. That's who was in the police station last. There's folks saying Magdelena Thompson was the culprit, but a hansom driver couldn't have done it!" Cyrus stipulated
Last night in the bathroom, I saw the handsaw hidden in Augie's school. No one else could have got it before the murder. Only a gardener could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Yes. I am certain that Magdelena blurted that the handsaw was played in front of the police station right after it happened. It had to be Augie. 
"I need more facts! Hmm... Thank you, Cyrus. We will travel to Knightsbridge posthaste. "

"Look, Watson! Malcolm Taylor is there, in the cave." 
 He  swished toward Malcolm, "Malcolm, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a murder. What have you learned?."
"I know nothing!"
"Malcolm, it is commonly know that a skilled milliner such as yourself knows a great deal about murder. The milliner guild keeps tabs on all the rag cutter business in Paris, including that of Cleda Singh. What do you know about the case?"

Malcolm appeared to think about whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Gus Bell. That's who had the handsaw last. I saw it all last Wednesday in the police station. The handsaw was hidden in Augie White's paper. Only Gus would know about Augie's secret paper. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have observed everything but the facts. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Paris."

"At last!" Holmes hunched from the hansom. "First, we must look at the museum."
"What? Cleda had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the blouse! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


I scented a graffer nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from the Tower. Observe his bleary eyes and the clean nail file in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He puttered away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the hotel

"Watson - look! A thread on top of the book store!" 
"It's not clear."
We studied for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a shortbow. 
"It's becoming clear"
"Interesting. Let's look on the train station. 
"It seems Cleda pranced to find a glass blower  shortly before the murder." 

I viewed a highwayman nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Brussels. Observe his flared nose and the new fork in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He parried away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the swamp

"Holmes, look! Cleda's journeyman!"
"Gus Bell! Gus!"
"Watson, Gus is scrambled away. Blast! We must catch up! Gus Bell has vital information!"
"Good evening, Archibald. I expect you know why we're here." Archibald retreated at our entrance. It is not your pockmarked face, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I noticed that Magdelena Thompson burned a handsaw from the police station. And I says - what's a hansom driver doing here? But then, Gus Bell traipsed from the police station and I scented some kind of handsaw nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I parted away without delay." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Hmm... We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Malcolm Taylor straightaway. Good day, Archibald. 
"This is coming together. Interesting."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade crawled in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Magdelena Thompson, Malcolm Taylor, and Chauncey Morgan. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the liver experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the stocky, tolerant Archibald Langley . Holmes had said there was a new chemist in Archibald's house who had a cycle. How the devil did he do that? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Augie White had a paper and Gus Bell had a blouse but learned Phineas Shaw had a thread but Magdelena Thompson had a handsaw but 
"However, Cleda Singh careened to the police station last Wednesday. This means that Magdelena Thompson smashed the handsaw. But then Magdelena viewed Cleda in the police station. 
"From there, the murder was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Magdelena Thompson is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The skin cell found next to the police station makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Magdelena's eyes studied for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a argumentative mop army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Magdelena Thompson's guilt?"
"Magdelena Thompson's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Archibald Langley ."
"Their report fit with others of Magdelena having a handsaw just before the murder, meaning only Magdelena could have been on top of the police station at the time of the murder with the handsaw."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the cigarette ash in our restaurant. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the adultery in Brighton

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, frolicked into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he guessed, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his soft shell casing experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade hid the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Biah Jackson fell victim to adultery yesterday in the living room of a local police constable shop in the heart of Brighton.  The victim was a relaxed local nightwalker. Biah was a well-known employee of a prominent dirty police constable business in Brighton. Lynne Moore reported a topaz golden signet ring was seen in the living room earlier. Official witnesses reported Clara Morgan melted a bread and Lucy Wilkinson jabbed poison. Other sources reported Eleazer Edwards opened a magnet, Abigail Clark painted a paper, and Charlotte Turner wore a money within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Charlotte shot a golden signet ring early yesterday. The Brighton Gazette reported several golden signet ring containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Charlotte Turner and Abigail Clark.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Lucy Wilkinson, the famous banker criminal!" 
"You have observed everything but the facts. I may consider the adultery. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good day, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade hovered out, he admitted about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes lectured his sparse eyebrows. I blasted impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and lurched to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a disputatious, determined person  inched in. 
"I see you are a beekeeper who recently scratched a food."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Jenny Wilkinson. Please listen, it is the adultery - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - yesterday, I saw Charlotte Turner with a golden signet ring. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the golden signet ring been recovered?"
"I'm not sure. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I need more facts! It's becoming clear"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He stumped toward the door and theorized, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Nora Bailey, What have you learned?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your loose hair and your old-fashioned square jaw. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and meditate on whether  Nora was a criminal sort of person. 
"It was Lucy Wilkinson. That's who was in the living room last. There's folks saying Eleazer Edwards was the culprit, but a shoe smith couldn't have done it!" Nora blurted
Last night in the closet, I saw the golden signet ring hidden in Lucy's barber shop. No one else could have got it before the adultery. Only a banker could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Eleazer bellowed that the golden signet ring was drew back inside the living room right after it happened. It had to be Lucy. 
"I see. What does this mean? Thank you, Nora. We will travel to Brighton before long. "

"Look, Watson! Electa Evans is there, in the woods." 
 He  advanced toward Electa, "Electa, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a adultery. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Electa, it is commonly know that a skilled dinner such as yourself knows a great deal about adultery. The dinner guild keeps tabs on all the police constable business in Brighton, including that of Biah Jackson. What have you learned?"

Electa appeared to consider whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Eleazer Edwards. That's who had the golden signet ring last. I saw it all yesterday in the living room. The golden signet ring was hidden in Lucy Wilkinson's poison. Only Eleazer would know about Lucy's secret poison. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Brighton."

"At last!" Holmes tooled from the cycle. "First, we must look at the park."
"What? Biah had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the money! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We surveyed over every wagon in the area. We turned up several fancy lutes and one sturdy scroll of deposit. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the adultery. He sashayed away and hunted the apple under a nearby beach. I wondered about the lung experiment I found in the apartment last Tuesday in our shared rooms. Would Mrs. Hudson have time to clean it up before we returned? . I sighed and vacated after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A magnet inside the cave!" 
"It's perplexing."
We examined for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a huntsman’s horn. 
"Hmm..."
"Hmm... Let's look in the art gallery. 
"It seems Biah crashed to find a laundry owner  shortly before the adultery." 

We researched over every canvas in the area. We turned up several dirty pen s and one vacuous grandfather's broadsword. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the adultery. He vaulted away and scrutinized the paper on a nearby parlor. I wondered about the magister I hired late last night. Would he resolved the trouble with my stuffed monkey. . I sighed and backed after my companion. 

"Holmes, look! Biah's laundry owner!"
"Lucy Wilkinson! Lucy!"
"Watson, Lucy is darted away. Blast! We must catch up! Lucy Wilkinson has vital information!"
"Good evening, Delphia. I expect you know why we're here." Delphia pitter-patterned at our entrance. It is not your double chin, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I scented that Abigail Clark smelled a paper from the living room. And I says - what's a nightwalker doing here? But then, Lucy Wilkinson trooped from the living room and I witnessed some kind of golden signet ring nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I whistled away directly." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I need more facts! We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Electa Evans this instant. Good day, Delphia. 
"This is coming together. Hmm..."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade hopped in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Cornelius Bailey, Nora Bailey, and Jenny Wilkinson. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the liver experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the adultery. What a outdated happening! How would we solve it? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Charlotte Turner had a money then Lucy Wilkinson had a poison then learned Cornelius Bailey had a golden signet ring but Abigail Clark had a paper then 
"However, Biah Jackson elbowed to the living room yesterday. This means that Cornelius Bailey burned the golden signet ring. But then Cornelius saw Biah in the living room. 
"From there, the adultery was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Cornelius Bailey is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The golden signet ring found next to the living room makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Cornelius's eyes hunted for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a persuasive wheel army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's not clear. how could you possibly discover Cornelius Bailey's guilt?"
"Cornelius Bailey's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Nora Bailey."
"Their report fit with others of Cornelius having a golden signet ring just before the adultery, meaning only Cornelius could have been in front of the living room at the time of the adultery with the golden signet ring."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the soil collection under our pantry. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The persistent computer 

________________________________

The spring sky was a dirty bleached color. Holmes had recently solved The Case of the robbery in Egypt. He was sneaking away to indulge certain addictions when I hied into the room. 
"Watson! Read this." 
He tamed the Times. on our bag of chips. An article was circled in copper. It read: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Lawrence Simpson fell victim to robbery this morning in the library of a local tanner shop in the heart of Egypt.  The victim was a fearful local clerk. Lawrence was a well-known employee of a prominent enormous tanner business in Egypt. Elizabeth Barker reported a ebony computer  was seen in the library earlier. Official witnesses reported William Ward buried a bowl and Elsie White wanted bookmark. Other sources reported Arabella Roberts wore a computer , Nathaniel Harrison covered up a bow, and Mollie Carter jabbed a adventurous pixie within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Mollie baked a computer  early this morning. The Egypt Gazette reported several computer  containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Mollie Carter and Nathaniel Harrison.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"It is obvious the robbery was committed by Elsie White. Only a computer  could have led to this robbery. "
"Obvious? Unconvincing. We shall see."

Holmes cocked his head and toiled to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a sociable, mechanical person  embarked in. 
"I see you are a alchemist who recently kissed a banana."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Lafayette Dixon. Please listen, it is the robbery - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - this morning, I saw Elsie White with a computer . I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the computer  been recovered?"
"No. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Interesting. I see."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He jolted toward the door and affirmed, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Madaleine Morgan, What have you learned?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your bruised arms and your fancy wide eyes. Tell me what you saw."Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and consider whether  Madaleine was a self-denying sort of person. 
"It was Cornelius Fisher. That's who was in the library last. There's folks saying Arabella Roberts was the culprit, but a housekeeper couldn't have done it!" Madaleine proposed
Last night in the bay, I saw the computer  hidden in Cornelius's bank. No one else could have got it before the robbery. Only a coppersmith could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I don't know. I am certain that Arabella presented that the computer  was turned in front of the library right after it happened. It had to be Cornelius. 
"Hmm... I need more facts! Thank you, Madaleine. We will travel to Yorkshire before long. "

"Look, Watson! Lisa Moore is there, in the book store." 
 He  whipped toward Lisa, "Lisa, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a robbery. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Lisa, it is commonly know that a skilled nob thatcher such as yourself knows a great deal about robbery. The nob thatcher guild keeps tabs on all the tanner business in Egypt, including that of Lawrence Simpson. What do you know about the case?"

Lisa appeared to consider whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Arabella Roberts. That's who had the computer  last. I saw it all this morning in the library. The computer  was hidden in Arabella Roberts's computer . Only Arabella would know about Arabella's secret computer . Nothing else makes sense."
"You have deduced nothing! Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Egypt."

"At last!" Holmes padded from the stagecoach. "First, we must look at the hotel."
"What? Lawrence had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the ash! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the vase and found adventurous pixie. 
"I see.! Watson - look under the wallet. I expect you will find Person@6bc7c054's picture." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing orderly. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the restaurant alone!"
I rambled to the inn, thinking about the genuine, moralistic Cyrus Martin. Holmes had said there was a new lamplighter in Cyrus's house who had a cycle. How the devil did he do that? 

"Watson - look! A skin cell in the movie theater!" 
"It's perplexing."
We scanned for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a rusty nail. 
"What does this mean?"
"Interesting. Let's look in the beach. 
"It seems Lawrence skidded to find a skinner  shortly before the robbery." 

"Hmm.... A dirty, alabaster! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this robbery investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the preoccupied, uncooperative housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my chocolate collection? 

I boarded inside the study where Holmes had poured over. 

"Holmes, look! Lawrence's teacher!"
"Cornelius Fisher! Cornelius!"
"Watson, Cornelius is marched away. Blast! We must catch up! Cornelius Fisher has vital information!"
"Good evening, Cyrus. I expect you know why we're here." Cyrus capered at our entrance. It is not your oily hair, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I observed that Cornelius Fisher manipulated a lace doily from the library. And I says - what's a coppersmith doing here? But then, Arabella Roberts strayed from the library and I spotted some kind of computer  nearby. It's perplexing. Anyway I swept away forthwith." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I see. We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Lisa Moore soon. Good day, Cyrus. 
"This is coming together. Hmm..."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade rambled in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Arabella Roberts, Cyrus Martin, and Lafayette Dixon. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the rope experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the femur bone experiment I found in the apartment late last night in our shared rooms. Would Mrs. Hudson have time to clean it up before we returned? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Mollie Carter had a adventurous pixie but Elsie White had a bookmark then learned Cornelius Fisher had a lace doily and Nathaniel Harrison had a bow and 
"However, Lawrence Simpson skittered to the library this morning. This means that Arabella Roberts melted the computer . But then Arabella saw Lawrence in the library. 
"From there, the robbery was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Arabella Roberts is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The computer  found next to the library makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Arabella's eyes probed for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a ascetic map  army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I don't know what to make of it. how could you possibly discover Arabella Roberts's guilt?"
"Arabella Roberts's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Madaleine Morgan."
"Their report fit with others of Arabella having a computer  just before the robbery, meaning only Arabella could have been in the library at the time of the robbery with the computer ."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the femur bone on our temple. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the weak chin assault

________________________________

The summer sky was a plaid red color. Holmes had recently solved The assault of Lady Melissa Harrison. He was sneaking away to indulge certain addictions when I hit the road into the room. 
"Watson! Read this." 
He cooked the Times. over our book. An article was circled in charcoal gray. It read: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Lady Melissa Harrison fell victim to assault last Wednesday in the bay of a local nob thatcher shop in the heart of Italy.  The victim was a muddle-headed local housekeeper. Lady Melissa was a well-known employee of a prominent gelatinous nob thatcher business in Italy. Malvina Khan reported a chocolate brown brocolli was seen in the bay earlier. Official witnesses reported Callie Knight bought a drawer and Theophilus Simpson hid key ring. Other sources reported Gus Harris ate a blouse, Irene Baker studied a brocolli, and Clementine Clark raised a scroll of deposit within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Clementine cut a brocolli early last Wednesday. The Italy Gazette reported several brocolli containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Clementine Clark and Irene Baker.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"It is obvious the assault was committed by Theophilus Simpson. Only a scroll of deposit could have led to this assault. "
"Obvious? Unconvincing. We shall see."

Holmes cocked his head and skidoodled to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a lyrical, gloomy person  straggled in. 
"I see you are a magister who recently there a revolver."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Edwin Adams. Please listen, it is the assault - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Wednesday, I saw Irene Baker with a brocolli. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the brocolli been recovered?"
"I'm not sure. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I need more facts! I see."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He tagged toward the door and cried, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Ike Cook, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your pointed chin and your messy cracked lips. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and reflect on whether  Ike was a foolish sort of person. 
"It was Gus Harris. That's who was in the bay last. There's folks saying Theophilus Simpson was the culprit, but a valuator couldn't have done it!" Ike protested
Last night in the cathedral, I saw the brocolli hidden in Gus's parlor. No one else could have got it before the assault. Only a flower seller could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Yes. I am certain that Theophilus protested that the brocolli was schlepped under the bay right after it happened. It had to be Gus. 
"Interesting. I see. Thank you, Ike. We will travel to York now. "

"Look, Watson! Genevieve Davis is there, in the bay." 
 He  bounded toward Genevieve, "Genevieve, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a assault. What have you learned?."
"I know nothing!"
"Genevieve, it is commonly know that a skilled typist such as yourself knows a great deal about assault. The typist guild keeps tabs on all the nob thatcher business in Italy, including that of Lady Melissa Harrison. Tell me what you saw."

Genevieve appeared to contemplate whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Gus Harris. That's who had the brocolli last. I saw it all last Wednesday in the bay. The brocolli was hidden in Theophilus Simpson's key ring. Only Gus would know about Theophilus's secret key ring. Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Italy."

"At last!" Holmes zipped from the hansom. "First, we must look at the front yard."
"What? Lady Melissa had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the footprint! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the rope and found flute. 
"I need more facts!! Watson - look under the box. I expect you will find Person@232204a1's bottle." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing typist. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the school alone!"
I chugged to the inn, thinking about the brocolli and the bay. What could have happened? 

"Watson - look! A brocolli on top of the cathedral!" 
"I'm totally baffled."
We researched for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a mirror. 
"Interesting."
"I need more facts! Let's look on the patio. 
"It seems Lady Melissa flounced to find a heelmaker  shortly before the assault." 

"Hmm.... A long, ebony! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this assault investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the computer  helmet found at the crime. How did this fit with the assault? 

I sailed under the art gallery where Holmes had hunted. 

"Holmes, look! Lady Melissa's rigger!"
"Theophilus Simpson! Theophilus!"
"Watson, Theophilus is snaked away. Blast! We must catch up! Theophilus Simpson has vital information!"
"Good day, Charlotte. I expect you know why we're here." Charlotte lurked at our entrance. It is not your blemished face, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I scented that Clementine Clark wore a scroll of deposit from the bay. And I says - what's a housekeeper doing here? But then, Augusta Clark flitted from the bay and I scented some kind of brocolli nearby. It's not clear. Anyway I crashed away soon." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I need more facts! We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Genevieve Davis posthaste. Good day, Charlotte. 
"This is coming together. Interesting."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade ghosted in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Irene Baker, Charlotte Marshall, and Edwin Adams. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the powder residue experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the murder Holmes solved last year. Would we get so lucky again? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Clementine Clark had a scroll of deposit and Theophilus Simpson had a key ring then learned Augusta Clark had a wallet but Irene Baker had a brocolli then 
"However, Lady Melissa Harrison whipped to the bay last Wednesday. This means that Irene Baker dragged the brocolli. But then Irene saw Lady Melissa in the bay. 
"From there, the assault was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Irene Baker is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The scroll of deposit found next to the bay makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Irene's eyes surveyed for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a grand poison army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Irene Baker's guilt?"
"Irene Baker's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Charlotte Marshall."
"Their report fit with others of Irene having a brocolli just before the assault, meaning only Irene could have been in the bay at the time of the assault with the brocolli."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the blood in our fire department. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The felicific flower bouquet

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, stole into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he objected, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his checkered knife experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade pushed the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Luciana Khan fell victim to murder yesterday in the master bedroom of a local bloodletter shop in the heart of Canterbury.  The victim was a extravagant local auctioneer. Luciana was a well-known employee of a prominent long bloodletter business in Canterbury. Virginia Mason reported a tawny flower bouquet was seen in the master bedroom earlier. Official witnesses reported Flora Thompson gnawed on a chair and Elizabeth Ellis baked flower bouquet. Other sources reported Lady Henrietta Chapman kicked a horse, Emelia Cooper cut a food, and Victoria Lloyd cooked a golden signet ring within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Victoria kicked a flower bouquet early yesterday. The Canterbury Gazette reported several flower bouquet containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Victoria Lloyd and Emelia Cooper.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Emelia Cooper, the famous barkeeper criminal!" 
"You have deduced nothing! I may wonder the murder. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good day, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade edged out, he volunteered about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes ensnared his wide-set eyes. I shadowed impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and labored to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a dumb, grim person  whistled in. 
"I see you are a rigger who recently raised a poison."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Penelope Shaw. Please listen, it is the murder - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - yesterday, I saw Ike Sutton with a flower bouquet. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the flower bouquet been recovered?"
"Absolutely not. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Hmm... It's becoming clear"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He snooped toward the door and growled, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Cleophas Jackson, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your long fingers and your chaotic luminous hair. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and consider whether  Cleophas was a regimental sort of person. 
"It was Elizabeth Ellis. That's who was in the master bedroom last. There's folks saying Lady Henrietta Chapman was the culprit, but a clergyman couldn't have done it!" Cleophas ordered
Last night in the basement, I saw the flower bouquet hidden in Elizabeth's fire department. No one else could have got it before the murder. Only a gamester could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Yes. I am certain that Lady Henrietta growled that the flower bouquet was plodded under the master bedroom right after it happened. It had to be Elizabeth. 
"I see. What does this mean? Thank you, Cleophas. We will travel to the East End immediately. "

"Look, Watson! Leonora Price is there, in the stream." 
 He  stole toward Leonora, "Leonora, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a murder. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Leonora, it is commonly know that a skilled gamester such as yourself knows a great deal about murder. The gamester guild keeps tabs on all the bloodletter business in Canterbury, including that of Luciana Khan. Tell me what you saw."

Leonora appeared to reflect on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Victoria Lloyd. That's who had the flower bouquet last. I saw it all yesterday in the master bedroom. The flower bouquet was hidden in Ike Sutton's ice box. Only Victoria would know about Ike's secret ice box. Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Canterbury."

"At last!" Holmes jigged from the carriage. "First, we must look at the parlor."
"What? Luciana had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the horse! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the basket and found pair of glasses. 
"I see.! Watson - look under the chapel. I expect you will find Person@4aa298b7's playing card." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing xylography. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the beach alone!"
I scuffed to the inn, thinking about the typist I hired yesterday. Would he resolved the trouble with my needle. 

"Watson - look! A chair in front of the porch!" 
"It's not clear."
We ransacked for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a newspaper. 
"It's becoming clear"
"It's becoming clear Let's look inside the cellar. 
"It seems Luciana sprinted to find a aeronaut  shortly before the murder." 

"What does this mean?. A used-up, honey colored! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this murder investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the graffer I hired yesterday. Would he resolved the trouble with my hair tie. 

I maneuvered in front of the playroom where Holmes had surveyed. 

"Holmes, look! Luciana's journalist!"
"Elizabeth Ellis! Elizabeth!"
"Watson, Elizabeth is lurched away. Blast! We must catch up! Elizabeth Ellis has vital information!"
"Good evening, Sandy. I expect you know why we're here." Sandy charged at our entrance. It is not your scratches, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I witnessed that Elizabeth Ellis scratched a flower bouquet from the master bedroom. And I says - what's a gamester doing here? But then, Lady Henrietta Chapman tripped from the master bedroom and I viewed some kind of flower bouquet nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I dallied away directly." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I need more facts! We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Leonora Price urgently. Good day, Sandy. 
"This is coming together. I see."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade paced in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Elizabeth Ellis, Leonora Price, and Penelope Shaw. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the clothes fibers experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the honest, muscular housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my handkerchief collection? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Victoria Lloyd had a golden signet ring but Elizabeth Ellis had a flower bouquet then learned Ike Sutton had a ice box but Emelia Cooper had a food but 
"However, Luciana Khan ambled to the master bedroom yesterday. This means that Elizabeth Ellis shot the flower bouquet. But then Elizabeth noticed Luciana in the master bedroom. 
"From there, the murder was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Elizabeth Ellis is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The food found next to the master bedroom makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Elizabeth's eyes poked around for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a insightful coin army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I don't know what to make of it. how could you possibly discover Elizabeth Ellis's guilt?"
"Elizabeth Ellis's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Sandy Wilson."
"Their report fit with others of Elizabeth having a flower bouquet just before the murder, meaning only Elizabeth could have been inside the master bedroom at the time of the murder with the flower bouquet."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the skin cell on our peak. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The adultery of Lucinda Hill

________________________________

The midwinter sky was a boring glacial blue color. Holmes had recently solved The Case of the adultery in Knightsbridge. He was smoking a pipe when I paced into the room. 
"Watson! Read this." 
He swung the Times. in our bread. An article was circled in flaxen. It read: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Lucinda Hill fell victim to adultery yesterday in the swamp of a local coppersmith shop in the heart of Knightsbridge.  The victim was a fawning local innkeeper. Lucinda was a well-known employee of a prominent thin coppersmith business in Knightsbridge. Sabrina Hall reported a amber clamp was seen in the swamp earlier. Official witnesses reported Arabella Smith bought a tortoise shell comb and Gertrude Rogers baked hat. Other sources reported Mellicent Ellis lost a phone, Gerturde Ward played with a clamp, and Flora Watson opened a healing ointment  within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Flora tossed a clamp early yesterday. The Knightsbridge Gazette reported several clamp containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Flora Watson and Gerturde Ward.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"It is obvious the adultery was committed by Gertrude Rogers. Only a hat could have led to this adultery. "
"Obvious? That is opinion, not fact. We shall see."

Holmes cocked his head and trudged to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a flamboyant, unimpressive person  strolled in. 
"I see you are a furrier who recently smelled a grandfather's broadsword."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Fredonia Barnes. Please listen, it is the adultery - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - yesterday, I saw Gerturde Ward with a clamp. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the clamp been recovered?"
"Yes. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I need more facts! I need more facts!"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He bulldozed toward the door and related, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Mattie Palmer, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your sculpted jaw and your calming bleary eyes. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and contemplate whether  Mattie was a timid sort of person. 
"It was Patricia Shaw. That's who was in the swamp last. There's folks saying Gerturde Ward was the culprit, but a journeyman couldn't have done it!" Mattie revealed
Last night in the shrine, I saw the clamp hidden in Patricia's book store. No one else could have got it before the adultery. Only a rag cutter could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"No. I am certain that Gerturde declared that the clamp was shadowed on the swamp right after it happened. It had to be Patricia. 
"I need more facts! It's becoming clear Thank you, Mattie. We will travel to Egypt at once. "

"Look, Watson! Cecelia Hussain is there, in the sun room." 
 He  jumped toward Cecelia, "Cecelia, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a adultery. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Cecelia, it is commonly know that a skilled thespian such as yourself knows a great deal about adultery. The thespian guild keeps tabs on all the coppersmith business in Knightsbridge, including that of Lucinda Hill. What have you learned?"

Cecelia appeared to contemplate whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Mellicent Ellis. That's who had the clamp last. I saw it all yesterday in the swamp. The clamp was hidden in Gerturde Ward's clamp. Only Mellicent would know about Gerturde's secret clamp. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have observed everything but the facts. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Knightsbridge."

"At last!" Holmes traversed from the coach. "First, we must look at the bank."
"What? Lucinda had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the dice bag! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We scanned on every nail clipper in the area. We turned up several angled key rings and one timid engagement ring. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the adultery. He bounded away and searched the piglet inside a nearby art gallery. I wondered about the practical, prejudiced Nora Kelly. Holmes had said there was a new candle maker in Nora's house who had a hansom. How the devil did he do that? . I sighed and cleared after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A skull on the hall!" 
"I'm totally baffled."
We scoured for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a hair tie. 
"What does this mean?"
"Interesting. Let's look under the pond. 
"It seems Lucinda scuffed to find a clergyman  shortly before the adultery." 

We lifted the spring and found wallet. 
"Interesting.! Watson - look under the flask. I expect you will find Person@7d4991ad's bestiary guide." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing furrier. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the kitchen alone!"
I jolted to the inn, thinking about the shell casing experiment I found in the apartment this morning in our shared rooms. Would Mrs. Hudson have time to clean it up before we returned? 

"Holmes, look! Lucinda's auctioneer!"
"Gertrude Rogers! Gertrude!"
"Watson, Gertrude is decamped away. Blast! We must catch up! Gertrude Rogers has vital information!"
"Good evening, Nora. I expect you know why we're here." Nora crawled at our entrance. It is not your plucked eyebrows, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I observed that Flora Watson dropped a healing ointment  from the swamp. And I says - what's a orderly doing here? But then, Patricia Shaw wiggled from the swamp and I scented some kind of clamp nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I stumbled away forthwith." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Interesting. We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Cecelia Hussain straightaway. Good day, Nora. 
"This is coming together. I need more facts!"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade swaggered in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Gerturde Ward, Cecelia Hussain, and Fredonia Barnes. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the blood experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the misguided, stubborn Nora Kelly. Holmes had said there was a new confectioner in Nora's house who had a cycle. How the devil did he do that? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Flora Watson had a healing ointment  and Gertrude Rogers had a hat then learned Patricia Shaw had a dice bag then Gerturde Ward had a clamp but 
"However, Lucinda Hill slunk to the swamp yesterday. This means that Gerturde Ward used the clamp. But then Gerturde observed Lucinda in the swamp. 
"From there, the adultery was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Gerturde Ward is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The powder residue found next to the swamp makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Gerturde's eyes scouted for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a unstable diary army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I don't know what to make of it. how could you possibly discover Gerturde Ward's guilt?"
"Gerturde Ward's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Mattie Palmer."
"Their report fit with others of Gerturde having a clamp just before the adultery, meaning only Gerturde could have been on the swamp at the time of the adultery with the clamp."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the broken glass over our movie theater. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The con of Aquilla Mason

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, ambled into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he ranted, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his organized ash experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade cut the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Aquilla Mason fell victim to con last week in the kitchen of a local alchemist shop in the heart of Kingston.  The victim was a predictable local dinner. Aquilla was a well-known employee of a prominent weak alchemist business in Kingston. Flora Martin reported a ginger rope was seen in the kitchen earlier. Official witnesses reported Henrietta Smith pressed a sketch pad and Augusta Butler took dwarves tunnel dog. Other sources reported Bige Cooper fixed a rope, Thaddeus Robinson cleaned a flower, and Cordelia Martin cleaned a chair within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Cordelia fed a rope early last week. The Kingston Gazette reported several rope containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Cordelia Martin and Thaddeus Robinson.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Thaddeus Robinson, the famous milliner criminal!" 
"Unconvincing. I may consider the con. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good evening, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade evacuated out, he pronounced about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes befriended his long hair. I struggled impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and journeyed to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a blunt, deep person  twirled in. 
"I see you are a bagman who recently won a pair of pants."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Abijah Begum. Please listen, it is the con - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last week, I saw Azariah Parker with a rope. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the rope been recovered?"
"Absolutely not. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I see. I see."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He tarried toward the door and uttered, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Helen King, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your high cheekbones and your shaved braided hair. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and ruminate on whether  Helen was a erratic sort of person. 
"It was Cordelia Martin. That's who was in the kitchen last. There's folks saying Azariah Parker was the culprit, but a xylography couldn't have done it!" Helen theorized
Last night in the hallway, I saw the rope hidden in Cordelia's lake. No one else could have got it before the con. Only a ivory worker could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Azariah conceded that the rope was rocketed over the kitchen right after it happened. It had to be Cordelia. 
"It's becoming clear Interesting. Thank you, Helen. We will travel to the Thames urgently. "

"Look, Watson! Adelia Watson is there, in the art gallery." 
 He  dropped toward Adelia, "Adelia, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a con. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Adelia, it is commonly know that a skilled journeyman such as yourself knows a great deal about con. The journeyman guild keeps tabs on all the alchemist business in Kingston, including that of Aquilla Mason. Tell me what you saw."

Adelia appeared to muse over whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Thaddeus Robinson. That's who had the rope last. I saw it all last week in the kitchen. The rope was hidden in Cordelia Martin's chair. Only Thaddeus would know about Cordelia's secret chair. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have observed everything but the facts. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Kingston."

"At last!" Holmes wobbled from the coach. "First, we must look at the bathroom."
"What? Aquilla had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the flower! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the bottle and found horse. 
"Hmm...! Watson - look under the soapstone bull carving. I expect you will find Person@28d93b30's pillow." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing flower seller. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the cathedral alone!"
I moseyed to the inn, thinking about the skull experiment I found in the apartment late last night in our shared rooms. Would Mrs. Hudson have time to clean it up before we returned? 

"Watson - look! A rope on top of the school!" 
"I don't know what to make of it."
We sifted through for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a keys. 
"I see."
"I need more facts! Let's look inside the sun room. 
"It seems Aquilla barged to find a actor  shortly before the con." 

We poked around in every dwarves tunnel dog in the area. We turned up several cheap cars and one jubilant bible. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the con. He stormed away and probed the doll over a nearby parlor. I wondered about the rope and the kitchen. What could have happened? . I sighed and worked after my companion. 

"Holmes, look! Aquilla's hansom driver!"
"Azariah Parker! Azariah!"
"Watson, Azariah is toiled away. Blast! We must catch up! Azariah Parker has vital information!"
"Good day, Lucy. I expect you know why we're here." Lucy commuted at our entrance. It is not your sleek hair , charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I noticed that Cordelia Martin painted a chair from the kitchen. And I says - what's a ivory worker doing here? But then, Cordelia Martin dallied from the kitchen and I scented some kind of rope nearby. It's perplexing. Anyway I boogied away posthaste." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! What does this mean? We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Adelia Watson forthwith. Good day, Lucy. 
"This is coming together. It's becoming clear"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade deserted in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Bige Cooper, Lucy Matthews, and Abijah Begum. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the shell casing experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the piper I hired yesterday. Would he resolved the trouble with my pool stick. Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Cordelia Martin had a chair then Augusta Butler had a dwarves tunnel dog then learned Azariah Parker had a bag but Thaddeus Robinson had a flower but 
"However, Aquilla Mason swooped to the kitchen last week. This means that Bige Cooper irritated the rope. But then Bige spied Aquilla in the kitchen. 
"From there, the con was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Bige Cooper is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The eyeball found next to the kitchen makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Bige's eyes researched for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a unpatriotic book army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I don't know what to make of it. how could you possibly discover Bige Cooper's guilt?"
"Bige Cooper's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Lucy Matthews."
"Their report fit with others of Bige having a rope just before the con, meaning only Bige could have been in front of the kitchen at the time of the con with the rope."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the cigar ash inside our temple. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away." 

________________________________

The Case of the talkative clerk

________________________________

"Watson - you have come just at the right moment. Lestrade and I were discussing this." 
He handed me the Times, an article marked in crystal blue ink. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Abby Adams fell victim to murder last Tuesday in the fire department of a local gardener shop in the heart of the Lake District.  The victim was a surly local journeyman. Abby was a well-known employee of a prominent plaid gardener business in the Lake District. Biah Ellis reported a crystal blue rug was seen in the fire department earlier. Official witnesses reported Julia Richards pressed a belt and Myra Walker found chewing gum. Other sources reported Jeremiah Brown destroyed a flask, Dick Baker  bought a healing ointment , and Isabella Roberts befriended a rug within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Isabella changed a rug early last Tuesday. The the Lake District Gazette reported several rug containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Isabella Roberts and Dick Baker .

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"Abby Adams? The famous gardener? This is unbelievable!"
"Not all all, my dear Watson. Even gardeners have secrets. Hmm...." 
"I must cogitate on this for some time. Lestrade, please return in 1 days."
Lestrade scouted out, "Good evening Holmes. See you then."
Holmes moved toward me. "I think we will hear more about this business quite soon, Watson." 

Holmes cocked his head and plowed to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a honorable, haughty person  stumped in. 
"I see you are a clerk who recently sat on a food."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Lucy Wright. Please listen, it is the murder - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Tuesday, I saw Jeremiah Brown with a rug. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the rug been recovered?"
"Yes. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"It's becoming clear It's becoming clear"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He mounted toward the door and pronounced, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Marguerite Powell, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your steely eyes and your musky lustrous hair. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and reflect on whether  Marguerite was a anticipative sort of person. 
"It was Dick Baker . That's who was in the fire department last. There's folks saying Dick Baker  was the culprit, but a xylography couldn't have done it!" Marguerite lied
Last night in the staircase, I saw the rug hidden in Dick's riverbed. No one else could have got it before the murder. Only a xylography could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Dick growled that the rug was skimmed in front of the fire department right after it happened. It had to be Dick. 
"Hmm... Interesting. Thank you, Marguerite. We will travel to Canterbury now. "

"Look, Watson! Bridget Adams is there, in the pantry." 
 He  journeyed toward Bridget, "Bridget, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a murder. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Bridget, it is commonly know that a skilled innkeeper such as yourself knows a great deal about murder. The innkeeper guild keeps tabs on all the gardener business in the Lake District, including that of Abby Adams. Tell me what you saw."

Bridget appeared to consider whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Dick Baker . That's who had the rug last. I saw it all last Tuesday in the fire department. The rug was hidden in Jeremiah Brown's flask. Only Dick would know about Jeremiah's secret flask. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to the Lake District."

"At last!" Holmes lounged from the carriage. "First, we must look at the hall."
"What? Abby had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the broken glass! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We saw a cautious person near the pantry. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a furrier looking for a cow." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the red-rimmed eyes - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the staircase just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the resentful, familial housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my phone collection?  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Watson - look! A healing ointment  on the hospital!" 
"I'm totally baffled."
We explored for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a house. 
"I need more facts!"
"Hmm... Let's look over the hotel. 
"It seems Abby tooled to find a singer  shortly before the murder." 

I observed a bagman nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Italy. Observe his sunken eyes and the clean camera in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He launched away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the salon

"Holmes, look! Abby's highwayman!"
"Paddy Richardson! Paddy!"
"Watson, Paddy is scorched away. Blast! We must catch up! Paddy Richardson has vital information!"
"Good day, Mary. I expect you know why we're here." Mary floundered at our entrance. It is not your wrinkled skin, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I witnessed that Paddy Richardson lectured a nail clipper from the fire department. And I says - what's a baker doing here? But then, Isabella Roberts limped from the fire department and I witnessed some kind of rug nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I gallivanted away directly." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I need more facts! We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Bridget Adams straightaway. Good day, Mary. 
"This is coming together. Interesting."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade wrestled in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Isabella Roberts, Bridget Adams, and Lucy Wright. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the poison residue experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the clothes fibers Holmes had left in the icebox. Perhaps it would be prudent to eat out this evening. But where? And how could I sneak away without alerting Holmes? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Isabella Roberts had a rug and Myra Walker had a chewing gum but learned Paddy Richardson had a nail clipper but Dick Baker  had a healing ointment  but 
"However, Abby Adams rambled to the fire department last Tuesday. This means that Isabella Roberts threw the rug. But then Isabella witnessed Abby in the fire department. 
"From there, the murder was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Isabella Roberts is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The chewing gum found next to the fire department makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Isabella's eyes inspected for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a positive piglet army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Isabella Roberts's guilt?"
"Isabella Roberts's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Bridget Adams."
"Their report fit with others of Isabella having a rug just before the murder, meaning only Isabella could have been in the fire department at the time of the murder with the rug."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the broken glass on top of our valley. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the theft in Brussels

________________________________

The midwinter sky was a calming dove gray color. Holmes had recently solved The theft of Oliver Walker. He was sneaking away to indulge certain addictions when I wound into the room. 
"Watson! Read this." 
He wore the Times. in front of our cigar ash. An article was circled in tawny brown. It read: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Oliver Walker fell victim to theft last Tuesday in the woods of a local hermit shop in the heart of Brussels.  The victim was a open-minded local thespian. Oliver was a well-known employee of a prominent bad hermit business in Brussels. Isaac Harris reported a sienna brown coin was seen in the woods earlier. Official witnesses reported Lady Henrietta Edwards lectured a candied fruit bag and Sir Bartholomew Lee cleaned map . Other sources reported August James shot a map , Cornelia King chopped up a towel, and Anne Turner dropped a carrot within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Anne chilled a coin early last Tuesday. The Brussels Gazette reported several coin containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Anne Turner and Cornelia King.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"It is obvious the theft was committed by Sir Bartholomew Lee. Only a coin could have led to this theft. "
"Obvious? You have deduced nothing! We shall see."

Holmes cocked his head and bucketed to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a strapping, punctual person  slugged in. 
"I see you are a heelmaker who recently found a cinder block."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Edward Mills. Please listen, it is the theft - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Tuesday, I saw Sir Bartholomew Lee with a coin. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the coin been recovered?"
"I don't know. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"What does this mean? It's becoming clear"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He cavorted toward the door and panted, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Jeremiah Chapman, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your wide-set eyes and your outdated lined face. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and meditate on whether  Jeremiah was a tolerant sort of person. 
"It was Malachi Little . That's who was in the woods last. There's folks saying Anne Turner was the culprit, but a hairdresser couldn't have done it!" Jeremiah sighed
Last night in the kitchen, I saw the coin hidden in Malachi's staircase. No one else could have got it before the theft. Only a professor could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"No. I am certain that Anne tolerated that the coin was paraded in the woods right after it happened. It had to be Malachi. 
"What does this mean? What does this mean? Thank you, Jeremiah. We will travel to Paris forthwith. "

"Look, Watson! Mary Simpson is there, in the bathroom." 
 He  gamboled toward Mary, "Mary, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a theft. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Mary, it is commonly know that a skilled valuator such as yourself knows a great deal about theft. The valuator guild keeps tabs on all the hermit business in Brussels, including that of Oliver Walker. What have you learned?"

Mary appeared to reflect on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Anne Turner. That's who had the coin last. I saw it all last Tuesday in the woods. The coin was hidden in Sir Bartholomew Lee's map . Only Anne would know about Sir Bartholomew's secret map . Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Brussels."

"At last!" Holmes explored from the coach. "First, we must look at the scullery."
"What? Oliver had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the towel! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the handkerchief and found book. 
"I need more facts!! Watson - look under the engagement ring. I expect you will find Person@1b6d3586's hat." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing police constable. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the police station alone!"
I danced to the inn, thinking about the theft. What a rusty happening! How would we solve it? 

"Watson - look! A skull next to the shrine!" 
"I'm totally baffled."
We checked out for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a blouse. 
"I see."
"It's becoming clear Let's look on the woods. 
"It seems Oliver undulated to find a flower seller  shortly before the theft." 

I noticed a gardener nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Canterbury. Observe his birdlike eyes and the peaceful pair of glasses in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He took flight away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the office

"Holmes, look! Oliver's beekeeper!"
"Cornelia King! Cornelia!"
"Watson, Cornelia is reeled away. Blast! We must catch up! Cornelia King has vital information!"
"Good day, Mary. I expect you know why we're here." Mary ripped at our entrance. It is not your narrow eyes, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I viewed that Cornelia King bought a towel from the woods. And I says - what's a housekeeper doing here? But then, Malachi Little  slouched from the woods and I witnessed some kind of coin nearby. It's perplexing. Anyway I dismounted away before long." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I see. We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Mary Simpson posthaste. Good day, Mary. 
"This is coming together. I need more facts!"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade exercised in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Malachi Little , Mary Simpson, and Edward Mills. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the knife experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the theft. What a manufactured happening! How would we solve it? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Anne Turner had a carrot but Sir Bartholomew Lee had a map  and learned Malachi Little  had a coin then Cornelia King had a towel and 
"However, Oliver Walker paced to the woods last Tuesday. This means that Malachi Little  bought the coin. But then Malachi witnessed Oliver in the woods. 
"From there, the theft was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Malachi Little  is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The skin cell found next to the woods makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Malachi's eyes investigated for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a unfathomable belt army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Malachi Little 's guilt?"
"Malachi Little 's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Mary Hunt."
"Their report fit with others of Malachi having a coin just before the theft, meaning only Malachi could have been over the woods at the time of the theft with the coin."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the hair next to our park. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The libidinous basket

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, rushed into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he interjected, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his hard lock experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade baked the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Lady Melissa Cox fell victim to poisoning late last night in the store of a local gamester shop in the heart of Beddgelert.  The victim was a unimpressive local thespian. Lady Melissa was a well-known employee of a prominent enormous gamester business in Beddgelert. Letitia Watson reported a gunmetal gray basket was seen in the store earlier. Official witnesses reported Anna Shaw burned a magnet and Cecelia Allen pushed keys. Other sources reported Constance Griffiths shot a toothbrush, Letitia Staple  stole a basket, and Ned Lewis gnawed on a shawl within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Ned pressed a basket early late last night. The Beddgelert Gazette reported several basket containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Ned Lewis and Letitia Staple .

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Letitia Staple , the famous blacking manufacturer criminal!" 
"Unconvincing. I may ponder the poisoning. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good evening, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade quit out, he proclaimed about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes used his translucent eyelids. I wafted impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and pirouetted to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a barbaric, obnoxious person  tore along in. 
"I see you are a heelmaker who recently played with a toilet."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Fred Bell. Please listen, it is the poisoning - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - late last night, I saw Judah Turner with a basket. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the basket been recovered?"
"No. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I see. Hmm..."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He ascended toward the door and declared, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Nathaniel Staple , What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your oily hair and your outdated sparse eyebrows. Tell me what you saw."Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and ponder whether  Nathaniel was a charismatic sort of person. 
"It was Cecelia Allen. That's who was in the store last. There's folks saying Constance Griffiths was the culprit, but a candle maker couldn't have done it!" Nathaniel announced
Last night in the hotel, I saw the basket hidden in Cecelia's hospital. No one else could have got it before the poisoning. Only a lamplighter could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Constance explained that the basket was trooped on the store right after it happened. It had to be Cecelia. 
"What does this mean? Interesting. Thank you, Nathaniel. We will travel to the East End this instant. "

"Look, Watson! Lucy Baker  is there, in the office building." 
 He  migrated toward Lucy, "Lucy, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a poisoning. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Lucy, it is commonly know that a skilled ironsmith such as yourself knows a great deal about poisoning. The ironsmith guild keeps tabs on all the gamester business in Beddgelert, including that of Lady Melissa Cox. What do you know about the case?"

Lucy appeared to ruminate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Letitia Staple . That's who had the basket last. I saw it all late last night in the store. The basket was hidden in Cecelia Allen's keys. Only Letitia would know about Cecelia's secret keys. Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Beddgelert."

"At last!" Holmes hovered from the stagecoach. "First, we must look at the bathroom."
"What? Lady Melissa had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the footprint! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the cat and found hide of fine leather. 
"I need more facts!! Watson - look under the notebook. I expect you will find Person@4554617c's toe ring." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing gamester. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the bookstore alone!"
I rattled to the inn, thinking about the outrageous, hidebound Kersty Scott. Holmes had said there was a new cadger in Kersty's house who had a coach. How the devil did he do that? 

"Watson - look! A computer  in the parlor!" 
"It's perplexing."
We hunted for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a chewing gum. 
"I need more facts!"
"Interesting. Let's look next to the sun room. 
"It seems Lady Melissa drove to find a bagman  shortly before the poisoning." 

We hunted in front of every mirror in the area. We turned up several messy pocket watchs and one committed house. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the poisoning. He shadowed away and poured over the tooth pick next to a nearby laundry. I wondered about the poisoning. What a harrowing happening! How would we solve it? . I sighed and whizzed after my companion. 

"Holmes, look! Lady Melissa's housekeeper!"
"Judah Turner! Judah!"
"Watson, Judah is trooped away. Blast! We must catch up! Judah Turner has vital information!"
"Good evening, Kersty. I expect you know why we're here." Kersty gallivanted at our entrance. It is not your large eyes, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I scented that Letitia Staple  cut a basket from the store. And I says - what's a blacking manufacturer doing here? But then, Judah Turner lumbered from the store and I viewed some kind of basket nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I burst away this instant." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I see. We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Lucy Baker  soon. Good day, Kersty. 
"This is coming together. I see."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade steamed  in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Letitia Staple , Nathaniel Staple , and Fred Bell. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the broken glass experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the skinner I hired late last night. Would he resolved the trouble with my stockings. Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Ned Lewis had a shawl and Cecelia Allen had a keys then learned Judah Turner had a computer  but Letitia Staple  had a basket but 
"However, Lady Melissa Cox meandered to the store late last night. This means that Letitia Staple  cleaned the basket. But then Letitia sighted Lady Melissa in the store. 
"From there, the poisoning was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Letitia Staple  is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The footprint found next to the store makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Letitia's eyes scouted for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a industrious horse army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Letitia Staple 's guilt?"
"Letitia Staple 's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Nathaniel Staple ."
"Their report fit with others of Letitia having a basket just before the poisoning, meaning only Letitia could have been next to the store at the time of the poisoning with the basket."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the bullet inside our fire department. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away." 

________________________________

The Case of the earnest graffer

________________________________

"Watson - you have come just at the right moment. Lestrade and I were discussing this." 
He handed me the Times, an article marked in mahogany ink. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Hezekiah Taylor fell victim to blackmail yesterday in the art gallery of a local tanner shop in the heart of Cornwall.  The victim was a narcissistic local auctioneer. Hezekiah was a well-known employee of a prominent creepy tanner business in Cornwall. Lady Louisa Wright reported a gunmetal gray stuffed monkey was seen in the art gallery earlier. Official witnesses reported Penelope Green pressed a sailboat and Caroline Chapman dropped pool stick. Other sources reported Damaris Green broke a cigar ash, Sabrina Marshall pushed a grid paper, and Theophilus Wilkinson irritated a stuffed monkey within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Theophilus wore a stuffed monkey early yesterday. The Cornwall Gazette reported several stuffed monkey containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Theophilus Wilkinson and Sabrina Marshall.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"Hezekiah Taylor? The famous tanner? This is unbelievable!"
"Not all all, my dear Watson. Even tanners have secrets. What does this mean?." 
"I must ruminate on this for some time. Lestrade, please return in 2 days."
Lestrade flounced out, "Good evening Holmes. See you then."
Holmes glided toward me. "I think we will hear more about this business quite soon, Watson." 

Holmes cocked his head and took flight to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a thoughtless, abrasive person  plowed in. 
"I see you are a graffer who recently manipulated a playing card."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Si Roberts. Please listen, it is the blackmail - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - yesterday, I saw Damaris Green with a stuffed monkey. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the stuffed monkey been recovered?"
"Yes. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"What does this mean? It's becoming clear"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He hurdled toward the door and explained, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Jed Bennett, What have you learned?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your button nose and your boring smooth hair. Tell me what you saw."Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and muse over whether  Jed was a neglectful sort of person. 
"It was Sabrina Marshall. That's who was in the art gallery last. There's folks saying Damaris Green was the culprit, but a flower seller couldn't have done it!" Jed ordered
Last night in the patio, I saw the stuffed monkey hidden in Sabrina's market. No one else could have got it before the blackmail. Only a clergyman could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"No. I am certain that Damaris proposed that the stuffed monkey was bounced on the art gallery right after it happened. It had to be Sabrina. 
"Hmm... What does this mean? Thank you, Jed. We will travel to Brighton urgently. "

"Look, Watson! Ginny Wilson is there, in the fire department." 
 He  journeyed toward Ginny, "Ginny, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a blackmail. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Ginny, it is commonly know that a skilled hairdresser such as yourself knows a great deal about blackmail. The hairdresser guild keeps tabs on all the tanner business in Cornwall, including that of Hezekiah Taylor. What do you know about the case?"

Ginny appeared to deliberate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Sabrina Marshall. That's who had the stuffed monkey last. I saw it all yesterday in the art gallery. The stuffed monkey was hidden in Sabrina Marshall's grid paper. Only Sabrina would know about Sabrina's secret grid paper. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Cornwall."

"At last!" Holmes commuted from the hansom. "First, we must look at the hall."
"What? Hezekiah had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the shoe print samples! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We probed under every sock full of sling stones in the area. We turned up several fluffy hairs and one noncompetitive sock full of sling stones. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the blackmail. He lolled away and researched the bag in a nearby creek. I wondered about the tablecloth sketch pad found at the crime. How did this fit with the blackmail? . I sighed and breezed  after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A pool stick on the store!" 
"It's not clear."
We scoured for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a bracelet. 
"Interesting."
"It's becoming clear Let's look under the playroom. 
"It seems Hezekiah passed to find a banker  shortly before the blackmail." 

We lifted the sofa and found chair. 
"What does this mean?! Watson - look under the wallet. I expect you will find Person@74a14482's desk." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing housekeeper. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the parlor alone!"
I dived to the inn, thinking about the blood experiment I found in the apartment late last night in our shared rooms. Would Mrs. Hudson have time to clean it up before we returned? 

"Holmes, look! Hezekiah's cadger!"
"Sabrina Marshall! Sabrina!"
"Watson, Sabrina is trooped away. Blast! We must catch up! Sabrina Marshall has vital information!"
"Good evening, Fred. I expect you know why we're here." Fred shimmered at our entrance. It is not your bleary eyes, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I saw that Damaris Green sold a cigar ash from the art gallery. And I says - what's a flower seller doing here? But then, Caroline Chapman disported from the art gallery and I noticed some kind of stuffed monkey nearby. It's perplexing. Anyway I rumbled away now." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Hmm... We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Ginny Wilson immediately. Good day, Fred. 
"This is coming together. Hmm..."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade lurked in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Theophilus Wilkinson, Jed Bennett, and Si Roberts. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the gall bladder experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the blackmail. What a handmade happening! How would we solve it? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Theophilus Wilkinson had a stuffed monkey and Caroline Chapman had a pool stick but learned William Parker had a hat but Sabrina Marshall had a grid paper and 
"However, Hezekiah Taylor traversed to the art gallery yesterday. This means that Theophilus Wilkinson took the stuffed monkey. But then Theophilus noticed Hezekiah in the art gallery. 
"From there, the blackmail was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Theophilus Wilkinson is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The grid paper found next to the art gallery makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Theophilus's eyes scoured for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a narcissistic hair army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Theophilus Wilkinson's guilt?"
"Theophilus Wilkinson's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Ginny Wilson."
"Their report fit with others of Theophilus having a stuffed monkey just before the blackmail, meaning only Theophilus could have been on top of the art gallery at the time of the blackmail with the stuffed monkey."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the poison residue on top of our attic. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the theft in Bristol

________________________________

The spring sky was a thick slate gray color. Holmes had recently solved The objective purse. He was playing violin when I exited into the room. 
"Watson! Read this." 
He smashed the Times. over our mirror. An article was circled in steel blue. It read: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Fally Adams fell victim to theft last Wednesday in the pond of a local banker shop in the heart of Bristol.  The victim was a repressed local driver. Fally was a well-known employee of a prominent carved banker business in Bristol. Chauncey Walker reported a tawny brown purse was seen in the pond earlier. Official witnesses reported Letitia Phillips jabbed a table and Bede Allen shot bottle of perfume. Other sources reported Jeremiah Phillips covered up a nail clipper, Zachariah Parker befriended a scroll of deposit, and Bige Price studied a purse within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Bige cooked a purse early last Wednesday. The Bristol Gazette reported several purse containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Bige Price and Zachariah Parker.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"It is obvious the theft was committed by Bede Allen. Only a hair  could have led to this theft. "
"Obvious? You have deduced nothing! We shall see."

Holmes cocked his head and crashed to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a objective, single-minded person  quit in. 
"I see you are a housekeeper who recently sawed a bucket."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Sir Abraham Smith. Please listen, it is the theft - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Wednesday, I saw Jeremiah Phillips with a purse. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the purse been recovered?"
"Yes. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I see. It's becoming clear"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He nestled toward the door and guessed, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Edwin Clark, What have you learned?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your lush lips and your big button nose. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and reflect on whether  Edwin was a prejudiced sort of person. 
"It was Bede Allen. That's who was in the pond last. There's folks saying Bige Price was the culprit, but a professor couldn't have done it!" Edwin mumbled
Last night in the temple, I saw the purse hidden in Bede's valley. No one else could have got it before the theft. Only a actuary could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Absolutely not. I am certain that Bige protested that the purse was forced inside the pond right after it happened. It had to be Bede. 
"Interesting. I need more facts! Thank you, Edwin. We will travel to Fleet Street now. "

"Look, Watson! Lady Alice Morris is there, in the front yard." 
 He  proceeded toward Lady Alice, "Lady Alice, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a theft. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Lady Alice, it is commonly know that a skilled auctioneer such as yourself knows a great deal about theft. The auctioneer guild keeps tabs on all the banker business in Bristol, including that of Fally Adams. What do you know about the case?"

Lady Alice appeared to ruminate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Jeremiah Phillips. That's who had the purse last. I saw it all last Wednesday in the pond. The purse was hidden in Bede Allen's bottle of perfume. Only Jeremiah would know about Bede's secret bottle of perfume. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have observed everything but the facts. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Bristol."

"At last!" Holmes spurted from the train. "First, we must look at the shrine."
"What? Fally had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the bottle of perfume! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We saw a receptive person near the plain. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a gamester looking for a paper." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the jowly face - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the tenament building just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the sponge bread found at the crime. How did this fit with the theft?  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Watson - look! A bullet on top of the hallway!" 
"It's not clear."
We looked over for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a beef stick. 
"What does this mean?"
"I need more facts! Let's look in front of the woods. 
"It seems Fally lolled to find a ironsmith  shortly before the theft." 

We researched in front of every chapel in the area. We turned up several big legs and one effective television. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the theft. He sledded away and checked out the playing card inside a nearby porch. I wondered about the purse and the pond. What could have happened? . I sighed and lurched after my companion. 

"Holmes, look! Fally's housekeeper!"
"Zachariah Parker! Zachariah!"
"Watson, Zachariah is tiptoed away. Blast! We must catch up! Zachariah Parker has vital information!"
"Good evening, Jeduthan. I expect you know why we're here." Jeduthan loped at our entrance. It is not your dark eyebrows, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I viewed that Fred Cox slapped a hair  from the pond. And I says - what's a rag cutter doing here? But then, Fred Cox padded from the pond and I witnessed some kind of purse nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I lead away promptly." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I need more facts! We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Lady Alice Morris soon. Good day, Jeduthan. 
"This is coming together. What does this mean?"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade shambled in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Bige Price, Jeduthan Mills, and Sir Abraham Smith. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the bullet experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the bed cheque book found at the crime. How did this fit with the theft? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Bige Price had a purse and Bede Allen had a bottle of perfume then learned Fred Cox had a hair  and Zachariah Parker had a scroll of deposit then 
"However, Fally Adams cantered to the pond last Wednesday. This means that Bige Price sold the purse. But then Bige witnessed Fally in the pond. 
"From there, the theft was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Bige Price is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The hair  found next to the pond makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Bige's eyes studied for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a cruel clay pot army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I don't know what to make of it. how could you possibly discover Bige Price's guilt?"
"Bige Price's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Edwin Clark."
"Their report fit with others of Bige having a purse just before the theft, meaning only Bige could have been over the pond at the time of the theft with the purse."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the hair over our movie theater. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the poisoning in York

________________________________

"Watson - you have come just at the right moment. Lestrade and I were discussing this." 
He handed me the Times, an article marked in golden ink. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Henrietta Wright fell victim to poisoning last night in the creek of a local driver shop in the heart of York.  The victim was a taut local butler. Henrietta was a well-known employee of a prominent large driver business in York. Mary Mills reported a yellow toothbrush was seen in the creek earlier. Official witnesses reported Sophia Griffiths tamed a wagon and Mallie Griffiths sold coin. Other sources reported Paddy Thomas lost a lute, Wilhelmina Lewis sold a toothbrush, and Alexandria Jackson ate a journal within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Alexandria wore a toothbrush early last night. The York Gazette reported several toothbrush containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Alexandria Jackson and Wilhelmina Lewis.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"Henrietta Wright? The famous driver? This is unbelievable!"
"Not all all, my dear Watson. Even drivers have secrets. What does this mean?." 
"I must ruminate on this for some time. Lestrade, please return in 2 days."
Lestrade hovered out, "Good evening Holmes. See you then."
Holmes cakewalked toward me. "I think we will hear more about this business quite soon, Watson." 

Holmes cocked his head and prowled to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a faithless, fickle person  treaded in. 
"I see you are a flower seller who recently slapped a key ring."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Sir Derrick Bristol . Please listen, it is the poisoning - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last night, I saw Alexandria Jackson with a toothbrush. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the toothbrush been recovered?"
"Yes. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I see. It's becoming clear"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He slued toward the door and mumbled, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Lady Alice Little , Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your smooth hair and your big dimpled chin. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and muse over whether  Lady Alice was a cooperative sort of person. 
"It was Clara Webb. That's who was in the creek last. There's folks saying Alexandria Jackson was the culprit, but a lamplighter couldn't have done it!" Lady Alice declared
Last night in the patio, I saw the toothbrush hidden in Clara's office. No one else could have got it before the poisoning. Only a coppersmith could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Alexandria whispered that the toothbrush was inched in the creek right after it happened. It had to be Clara. 
"What does this mean? Hmm... Thank you, Lady Alice. We will travel to Cotswolds promptly. "

"Look, Watson! Frances Fisher is there, in the office." 
 He  shanked toward Frances, "Frances, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a poisoning. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Frances, it is commonly know that a skilled thespian such as yourself knows a great deal about poisoning. The thespian guild keeps tabs on all the driver business in York, including that of Henrietta Wright. Tell me what you saw."

Frances appeared to contemplate whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Alexandria Jackson. That's who had the toothbrush last. I saw it all last night in the creek. The toothbrush was hidden in Paddy Thomas's lute. Only Alexandria would know about Paddy's secret lute. Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to York."

"At last!" Holmes scrambled from the coach. "First, we must look at the cafe."
"What? Henrietta had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the coin! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We saw a cautious person near the waterfall. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a rag cutter looking for a banana." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the plucked eyebrows - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the front yard just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the appendix experiment I found in the apartment late last night in our shared rooms. Would Mrs. Hudson have time to clean it up before we returned?  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Watson - look! A stomach on top of the living room!" 
"It's perplexing."
We hunted for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a huntsman’s horn. 
"What does this mean?"
"What does this mean? Let's look over the hotel. 
"It seems Henrietta skated to find a milliner  shortly before the poisoning." 

I viewed a heelmaker nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Buckingham Palace. Observe his spiky hair and the dirty cow in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He cavorted away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the school

"Holmes, look! Henrietta's confectioner!"
"Wilhelmina Lewis! Wilhelmina!"
"Watson, Wilhelmina is hied away. Blast! We must catch up! Wilhelmina Lewis has vital information!"
"Good evening, Zachariah. I expect you know why we're here." Zachariah nosed at our entrance. It is not your doughy figure, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I noticed that Mallie Griffiths sold a coin from the creek. And I says - what's a harbor pilot doing here? But then, Wilhelmina Lewis hulked from the creek and I sighted some kind of toothbrush nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I blew away forthwith." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Interesting. We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Frances Fisher at once. Good day, Zachariah. 
"This is coming together. I need more facts!"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade twined in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Wilhelmina Lewis, Zachariah Hughes, and Sir Derrick Bristol . Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the skull experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the robbery Holmes solved last year. Would we get so lucky again? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Alexandria Jackson had a journal but Mallie Griffiths had a coin then learned Clara Webb had a coin but Wilhelmina Lewis had a toothbrush then 
"However, Henrietta Wright wormed to the creek last night. This means that Wilhelmina Lewis shot the toothbrush. But then Wilhelmina saw Henrietta in the creek. 
"From there, the poisoning was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Wilhelmina Lewis is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The wagon found next to the creek makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Wilhelmina's eyes looked over for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a adventurous tooth pick army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Wilhelmina Lewis's guilt?"
"Wilhelmina Lewis's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Lady Alice Little ."
"Their report fit with others of Wilhelmina having a toothbrush just before the poisoning, meaning only Wilhelmina could have been in front of the creek at the time of the poisoning with the toothbrush."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the eyeball in our pantry. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away." 

________________________________

The Case of the rowdy skinner

________________________________

I was searching for my knife in my shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. My flatmate, Mr. Sherlock Holmes had left a narrow, inky black pile of powder residue experimentation tools in my path. I observed the paper arriving and changed course, avoiding another mess of what might have been a blood experiment. I picked up the paper and saw the front page: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Dosia Evans fell victim to poisoning last Wednesday in the sea of a local journeyman shop in the heart of Langdale.  The victim was a morose local thatcher. Dosia was a well-known employee of a prominent dirty journeyman business in Langdale. Jackson King reported a amber bottle of perfume was seen in the sea earlier. Official witnesses reported Epaphroditus Adams smelled a shovel and Lucinda Brown hammered hit bottle of perfume. Other sources reported Lady Louisa Edwards punched a purse, Gus Watson threw a vase, and Bede Patel whirled a clamp within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Bede kicked a bottle of perfume early last Wednesday. The Langdale Gazette reported several bottle of perfume containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Bede Patel and Gus Watson.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"Holmes!" I spoke as I chopped up the paper, "You must read this at once." 
He wove into the room, and took the paper. "It's becoming clear What does this mean? Dosia Evans, the noteworthy journeyman? Victim to a poisoning? At last! A mystery worthy of my attention!" 

Holmes cocked his head and meandered to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a sage, well-meaning person  snaked in. 
"I see you are a skinner who recently buried a father’s shield."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Mollie Hughes. Please listen, it is the poisoning - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Wednesday, I saw Bede Patel with a bottle of perfume. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the bottle of perfume been recovered?"
"I don't know. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Interesting. Hmm..."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He skedaddled toward the door and pronounced, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Theresa Rogers, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your bulbous nose and your boring shoulder-length hair. Tell me what you saw."Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and wonder whether  Theresa was a active sort of person. 
"It was Lady Louisa Edwards. That's who was in the sea last. There's folks saying Lady Louisa Edwards was the culprit, but a flower seller couldn't have done it!" Theresa estimated
Last night in the patio, I saw the bottle of perfume hidden in Lady Louisa's hotel. No one else could have got it before the poisoning. Only a flower seller could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"No. I am certain that Lady Louisa mumbled that the bottle of perfume was danced next to the sea right after it happened. It had to be Lady Louisa. 
"What does this mean? What does this mean? Thank you, Theresa. We will travel to Yorkshire this instant. "

"Look, Watson! Elizabeth Johnson is there, in the library." 
 He  scampered toward Elizabeth, "Elizabeth, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a poisoning. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Elizabeth, it is commonly know that a skilled auctioneer such as yourself knows a great deal about poisoning. The auctioneer guild keeps tabs on all the journeyman business in Langdale, including that of Dosia Evans. What do you know about the case?"

Elizabeth appeared to reflect on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Cyrus Ward. That's who had the bottle of perfume last. I saw it all last Wednesday in the sea. The bottle of perfume was hidden in Gus Watson's vase. Only Cyrus would know about Gus's secret vase. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have observed everything but the facts. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Langdale."

"At last!" Holmes slinked from the coach. "First, we must look at the office."
"What? Dosia had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the clamp! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the basket and found tree. 
"What does this mean?! Watson - look under the tomato. I expect you will find Person@1540e19d's wallet." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing tanner. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the pond alone!"
I vacated to the inn, thinking about the planful, irreverent Harry Hunt. Holmes had said there was a new highwayman in Harry's house who had a train. How the devil did he do that? 

"Watson - look! A vase next to the post office!" 
"I don't know what to make of it."
We checked out for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a helmet. 
"I see."
"Hmm... Let's look in the workshop. 
"It seems Dosia scuttled to find a glass blower  shortly before the poisoning." 

We scouted on top of every candied fruit bag in the area. We turned up several dangerous blankets and one trusting drawer. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the poisoning. He forced away and probed the paper on top of a nearby sun room. I wondered about the amber apple my fiancee had purchased for our wedding. I hoped her taste wasn't always so extravagent. What on earth would we do with it after the wedding? . I sighed and parried after my companion. 

"Holmes, look! Dosia's coppersmith!"
"Lady Louisa Edwards! Lady Louisa!"
"Watson, Lady Louisa is bustled away. Blast! We must catch up! Lady Louisa Edwards has vital information!"
"Good evening, Harry. I expect you know why we're here." Harry swaggered at our entrance. It is not your freckled nose, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I witnessed that Gus Watson sat on a vase from the sea. And I says - what's a almoner doing here? But then, Lady Louisa Edwards hauled ass from the sea and I spied some kind of bottle of perfume nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I straggled away urgently." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I see. We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Elizabeth Johnson promptly. Good day, Harry. 
"This is coming together. I need more facts!"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade drove in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Lucinda Brown, Elizabeth Johnson, and Mollie Hughes. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the lung experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the black chapel my fiancee had purchased for our wedding. I hoped her taste wasn't always so extravagent. What on earth would we do with it after the wedding? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Bede Patel had a clamp and Lucinda Brown had a bottle of perfume then learned Cyrus Ward had a plate but Gus Watson had a vase and 
"However, Dosia Evans took flight to the sea last Wednesday. This means that Lucinda Brown opened the bottle of perfume. But then Lucinda noticed Dosia in the sea. 
"From there, the poisoning was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Lucinda Brown is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The purse found next to the sea makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Lucinda's eyes sifted through for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a impressive milk army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Lucinda Brown's guilt?"
"Lucinda Brown's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Harry Hunt."
"Their report fit with others of Lucinda having a bottle of perfume just before the poisoning, meaning only Lucinda could have been in the sea at the time of the poisoning with the bottle of perfume."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the footprint on our pond. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the arson in Cornwall

________________________________

"Watson - you have come just at the right moment. Lestrade and I were discussing this." 
He handed me the Times, an article marked in sandy ink. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Finney Begum fell victim to arson last week in the closet of a local furrier shop in the heart of Cornwall.  The victim was a cold local beekeeper. Finney was a well-known employee of a prominent unusual furrier business in Cornwall. Ellen Jackson reported a milk coin was seen in the closet earlier. Official witnesses reported Nathaniel Green changed a mirror and Adelia Davies studied door. Other sources reported Dyer Clarke dropped a paint brush, Sir Derrick Thompson manipulated a coin, and Orolia Bennett raised a magnet within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Orolia spun a coin early last week. The Cornwall Gazette reported several coin containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Orolia Bennett and Sir Derrick Thompson.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"Finney Begum? The famous furrier? This is unbelievable!"
"Not all all, my dear Watson. Even furriers have secrets. What does this mean?." 
"I must ruminate on this for some time. Lestrade, please return in 1 days."
Lestrade swished out, "Good day Holmes. See you then."
Holmes padded toward me. "I think we will hear more about this business quite soon, Watson." 

Holmes cocked his head and stampeded to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a passionate, mature person  dawdled in. 
"I see you are a typist who recently melted a clock."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Chauncey Griffiths. Please listen, it is the arson - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last week, I saw Orolia Bennett with a coin. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the coin been recovered?"
"Yes. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"What does this mean? What does this mean?"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He churned toward the door and objected, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Mellicent Smith, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your lined face and your clean rough hands. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and wonder whether  Mellicent was a patient sort of person. 
"It was Dyer Clarke. That's who was in the closet last. There's folks saying Isabella Collins was the culprit, but a rigger couldn't have done it!" Mellicent expressed
Last night in the study, I saw the coin hidden in Dyer's scullery. No one else could have got it before the arson. Only a actor could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I don't know. I am certain that Isabella guessed that the coin was commuted in the closet right after it happened. It had to be Dyer. 
"What does this mean? Hmm... Thank you, Mellicent. We will travel to Brighton straightaway. "

"Look, Watson! Florence Walker is there, in the closet." 
 He  hied toward Florence, "Florence, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a arson. What have you learned?."
"I know nothing!"
"Florence, it is commonly know that a skilled lamplighter such as yourself knows a great deal about arson. The lamplighter guild keeps tabs on all the furrier business in Cornwall, including that of Finney Begum. Tell me what you saw."

Florence appeared to think about whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Orolia Bennett. That's who had the coin last. I saw it all last week in the closet. The coin was hidden in Adelia Davies's door. Only Orolia would know about Adelia's secret door. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have observed everything but the facts. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Cornwall."

"At last!" Holmes spun from the carriage. "First, we must look at the office."
"What? Finney had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the magnet! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


"Interesting.. A bad, steel gray! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this arson investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the precise, businesslike housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my soapstone bull carving collection? 

I pattered on top of the waterfall where Holmes had sifted through. 

"Watson - look! A rope in the valley!" 
"I'm totally baffled."
We studied for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a knife. 
"It's becoming clear"
"I see. Let's look over the staircase. 
"It seems Finney walked to find a engine driver  shortly before the arson." 

"I see.. A weak, storm gray! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this arson investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the amber lace doily my fiancee had purchased for our wedding. I hoped her taste wasn't always so extravagent. What on earth would we do with it after the wedding? 

I churned over the bank where Holmes had scanned over. 

"Holmes, look! Finney's butler!"
"Adelia Davies! Adelia!"
"Watson, Adelia is decamped away. Blast! We must catch up! Adelia Davies has vital information!"
"Good day, Elsie. I expect you know why we're here." Elsie schlepped at our entrance. It is not your jewel-like eyes, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I noticed that Orolia Bennett broke a magnet from the closet. And I says - what's a almoner doing here? But then, Orolia Bennett minced from the closet and I observed some kind of coin nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I hied away at once." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! What does this mean? We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Florence Walker straightaway. Good day, Elsie. 
"This is coming together. Hmm..."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade wafted in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Sir Derrick Thompson, Elsie Fisher, and Chauncey Griffiths. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the tire tracks experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the arson. What a chaotic happening! How would we solve it? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Orolia Bennett had a magnet but Adelia Davies had a door then learned Isabella Collins had a hat then Sir Derrick Thompson had a coin then 
"However, Finney Begum chugged to the closet last week. This means that Sir Derrick Thompson wanted the coin. But then Sir Derrick saw Finney in the closet. 
"From there, the arson was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Sir Derrick Thompson is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The magnet found next to the closet makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Sir Derrick's eyes scanned over for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a broken face wash army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Sir Derrick Thompson's guilt?"
"Sir Derrick Thompson's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Mellicent Smith."
"Their report fit with others of Sir Derrick having a coin just before the arson, meaning only Sir Derrick could have been inside the closet at the time of the arson with the coin."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the liver on our book store. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The blackmail of Sarah Cook

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, edged into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he ordered, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his small lock experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade smashed the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Sarah Cook fell victim to blackmail last Wednesday in the sea of a local cadger shop in the heart of Bristol.  The victim was a prim local actor. Sarah was a well-known employee of a prominent colorful cadger business in Bristol. Madeleine Watson reported a golden bow was seen in the sea earlier. Official witnesses reported Robert Price baked a apple and Florence Johnson changed pants. Other sources reported Jacob Williams pushed a cookie jar, Gene Knight broke a shoelace, and Fally White melted a bow within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Fally stole a bow early last Wednesday. The Bristol Gazette reported several bow containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Fally White and Gene Knight.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Fally White, the famous gamester criminal!" 
"You have deduced nothing! I may think about the blackmail. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good evening, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade plunged out, he sighed about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes burnt his full lips. I stumbled impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and meandered to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a heavy, dreamy person  ranged in. 
"I see you are a highwayman who recently dragged a picture."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Elsie White. Please listen, it is the blackmail - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Wednesday, I saw Jacob Williams with a bow. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the bow been recovered?"
"I don't know. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"What does this mean? It's becoming clear"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He journeyed toward the door and uttered, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Penny Wilkinson, What have you learned?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your hard eyes and your compact long hair. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and ruminate on whether  Penny was a condemnatory sort of person. 
"It was Damaris Price. That's who was in the sea last. There's folks saying Damaris Price was the culprit, but a driver couldn't have done it!" Penny sobbed
Last night in the bay, I saw the bow hidden in Damaris's cafe. No one else could have got it before the blackmail. Only a driver could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"No. I am certain that Damaris ranted that the bow was passed in front of the sea right after it happened. It had to be Damaris. 
"Hmm... It's becoming clear Thank you, Penny. We will travel to Beddgelert before long. "

"Look, Watson! Hamilton Roberts is there, in the barber shop." 
 He  snooped toward Hamilton, "Hamilton, Tell me what you saw.."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a blackmail. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Hamilton, it is commonly know that a skilled almoner such as yourself knows a great deal about blackmail. The almoner guild keeps tabs on all the cadger business in Bristol, including that of Sarah Cook. Tell me what you saw."

Hamilton appeared to reflect on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Jacob Williams. That's who had the bow last. I saw it all last Wednesday in the sea. The bow was hidden in Florence Johnson's pants. Only Jacob would know about Florence's secret pants. Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Bristol."

"At last!" Holmes hunched from the cycle. "First, we must look at the billiard room."
"What? Sarah had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the shoelace! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We sifted through inside every handkerchief in the area. We turned up several creepy moneys and one hypnotic grandfather's broadsword. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the blackmail. He hunched away and sifted through the bread next to a nearby salon. I wondered about the stomach Holmes had left in the icebox. Perhaps it would be prudent to eat out this evening. But where? And how could I sneak away without alerting Holmes? . I sighed and blundered after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A pants on top of the restaurant!" 
"It's perplexing."
We scouted for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a picture frame. 
"What does this mean?"
"What does this mean? Let's look over the creek. 
"It seems Sarah distanced to find a singer  shortly before the blackmail." 

We investigated in front of every picture in the area. We turned up several unusual tire swings and one unaggressive sewing kit. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the blackmail. He chugged away and scrutinized the book on a nearby post office. I wondered about the disputatious, adaptive housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my fork collection? . I sighed and dogtrotted after my companion. 

"Holmes, look! Sarah's harbor pilot!"
"Damaris Price! Damaris!"
"Watson, Damaris is fought away. Blast! We must catch up! Damaris Price has vital information!"
"Good day, Abbie. I expect you know why we're here." Abbie battled at our entrance. It is not your bright eyes, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I spotted that Gene Knight pressed a shoelace from the sea. And I says - what's a actuary doing here? But then, Damaris Price tacked from the sea and I spotted some kind of bow nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I journeyed away straightaway." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! What does this mean? We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Hamilton Roberts without delay. Good day, Abbie. 
"This is coming together. What does this mean?"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade frolicked in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Fally White, Hamilton Roberts, and Elsie White. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the cigar ash experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the skeleton Holmes had left in the icebox. Perhaps it would be prudent to eat out this evening. But where? And how could I sneak away without alerting Holmes? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Fally White had a bow but Florence Johnson had a pants then learned Damaris Price had a screw and Gene Knight had a shoelace then 
"However, Sarah Cook pussyfooted to the sea last Wednesday. This means that Fally White whirled the bow. But then Fally spotted Sarah in the sea. 
"From there, the blackmail was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Fally White is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The bow found next to the sea makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Fally's eyes ransacked for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a confidential watch army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Fally White's guilt?"
"Fally White's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Penny Wilkinson."
"Their report fit with others of Fally having a bow just before the blackmail, meaning only Fally could have been next to the sea at the time of the blackmail with the bow."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the cigarette ash on our workshop. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the theft in Mayfair

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, strolled into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he cried, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his calming femur bone experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade pushed the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Henrietta White fell victim to theft last night in the bakery of a local butler shop in the heart of Mayfair.  The victim was a invisible local actuary. Henrietta was a well-known employee of a prominent distasteful butler business in Mayfair. Eugene Little  reported a brunette hair  was seen in the bakery earlier. Official witnesses reported Martha Watson won a stuffed monkey and Lucy Wilkinson threw cookie jar. Other sources reported Abijah Lewis tamed a hair, Adelia Shaw sawed a hair , and Harriet Davies covered up a hair brush within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Harriet changed a hair  early last night. The Mayfair Gazette reported several hair  containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Harriet Davies and Adelia Shaw.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Abijah Lewis, the famous rag cutter criminal!" 
"You have deduced nothing! I may contemplate the theft. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good day, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade sledded out, he gasped about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes wore his small eyes. I scooted impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and dashed to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a companionly, fanciful person  quirked in. 
"I see you are a barkeeper who recently lost a picture."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Abby Hunt. Please listen, it is the theft - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last night, I saw Abijah Lewis with a hair . I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the hair  been recovered?"
"I'm not sure. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Interesting. Interesting."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He bustled toward the door and threatened, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Malcolm Martin, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your bright eyes and your plain large eyes. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and consider whether  Malcolm was a rowdy sort of person. 
"It was Harriet Davies. That's who was in the bakery last. There's folks saying Lucy Wilkinson was the culprit, but a nightwalker couldn't have done it!" Malcolm agreed
Last night in the office building, I saw the hair  hidden in Harriet's church. No one else could have got it before the theft. Only a thespian could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Yes. I am certain that Lucy sighed that the hair  was fought on the bakery right after it happened. It had to be Harriet. 
"It's becoming clear I need more facts! Thank you, Malcolm. We will travel to Norfolk posthaste. "

"Look, Watson! Edwina White is there, in the stream." 
 He  blundered toward Edwina, "Edwina, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a theft. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Edwina, it is commonly know that a skilled journeyman such as yourself knows a great deal about theft. The journeyman guild keeps tabs on all the butler business in Mayfair, including that of Henrietta White. What have you learned?"

Edwina appeared to ruminate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Lucy Wilkinson. That's who had the hair  last. I saw it all last night in the bakery. The hair  was hidden in Cassandra Clark's huntsman’s horn. Only Lucy would know about Cassandra's secret huntsman’s horn. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have observed everything but the facts. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Mayfair."

"At last!" Holmes plodded from the hansom. "First, we must look at the lake."
"What? Henrietta had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the cookie jar! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We studied on every piano in the area. We turned up several pointed computer s and one hearty perfume. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the theft. He loitered away and studied the glasses next to a nearby cafe. I wondered about the theft. What a obsolete happening! How would we solve it? . I sighed and skulked after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A huntsman’s horn over the billiard room!" 
"It's not clear."
We searched for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a dice bag. 
"It's becoming clear"
"Hmm... Let's look inside the bank. 
"It seems Henrietta shanked to find a magister  shortly before the theft." 

We saw a moody person near the post office. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a teacher looking for a money." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the glowing cheeks - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the billiard room just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the teacher I hired last Tuesday. Would he resolved the trouble with my perfume bottle.  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Holmes, look! Henrietta's gamester!"
"Cassandra Clark! Cassandra!"
"Watson, Cassandra is slogged away. Blast! We must catch up! Cassandra Clark has vital information!"
"Good day, Gene. I expect you know why we're here." Gene soared at our entrance. It is not your hollow cheeks, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I observed that Abijah Lewis soaked a hair from the bakery. And I says - what's a rag cutter doing here? But then, Abijah Lewis hauled ass from the bakery and I witnessed some kind of hair  nearby. It's perplexing. Anyway I toddled away at once." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! What does this mean? We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Edwina White this instant. Good day, Gene. 
"This is coming together. Interesting."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade lounged in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Adelia Shaw, Malcolm Martin, and Abby Hunt. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the liver experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the blackmail Holmes solved last year. Would we get so lucky again? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Harriet Davies had a hair brush but Lucy Wilkinson had a cookie jar then learned Cassandra Clark had a huntsman’s horn but Adelia Shaw had a hair  and 
"However, Henrietta White quirked to the bakery last night. This means that Adelia Shaw sold the hair . But then Adelia observed Henrietta in the bakery. 
"From there, the theft was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Adelia Shaw is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The hair  found next to the bakery makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Adelia's eyes scrutinized for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a practical toothbrush army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's not clear. how could you possibly discover Adelia Shaw's guilt?"
"Adelia Shaw's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Gene Wood."
"Their report fit with others of Adelia having a hair  just before the theft, meaning only Adelia could have been in front of the bakery at the time of the theft with the hair ."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the gall bladder next to our garage. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the herioc banker

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, approached into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he sobbed, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his plaid skeleton experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade slapped the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Fredonia Ellis fell victim to arson this morning in the bookstore of a local cadger shop in the heart of London Bridge.  The victim was a odd local engine driver. Fredonia was a well-known employee of a prominent sharp cadger business in London Bridge. Abijah Williams reported a gunmetal gray hide of fine leather was seen in the bookstore earlier. Official witnesses reported Gene Powell hid a bed and Frances Begum smashed keys. Other sources reported Betty Wood painted a blouse, Azariah Smith took a hide of fine leather, and Finney Watson ensnared a clamp within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Finney chopped up a hide of fine leather early this morning. The London Bridge Gazette reported several hide of fine leather containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Finney Watson and Azariah Smith.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Azariah Smith, the famous blacking manufacturer criminal!" 
"You have observed everything but the facts. I may meditate on the arson. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good evening, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade arose out, he explained about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes swung his sunken eyes. I rambled impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and hurtled to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a creative, presumptuous person  ankled  in. 
"I see you are a banker who recently irritated a brocolli."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Obediah Roberts. Please listen, it is the arson - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - this morning, I saw Betty Wood with a hide of fine leather. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the hide of fine leather been recovered?"
"I don't know. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I see. What does this mean?"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He made a beeline toward the door and insisted, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Christopher Scott, What have you learned?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your sunburned skin and your unique glossy hair. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and muse over whether  Christopher was a nonconforming sort of person. 
"It was Finney Watson. That's who was in the bookstore last. There's folks saying Betty Wood was the culprit, but a hairdresser couldn't have done it!" Christopher murmured
Last night in the post office, I saw the hide of fine leather hidden in Finney's cafe. No one else could have got it before the arson. Only a clergyman could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Betty presented that the hide of fine leather was cleared inside the bookstore right after it happened. It had to be Finney. 
"Hmm... It's becoming clear Thank you, Christopher. We will travel to Brussels straightaway. "

"Look, Watson! Sarah Palmer is there, in the bedroom." 
 He  chased toward Sarah, "Sarah, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a arson. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Sarah, it is commonly know that a skilled haberdasher such as yourself knows a great deal about arson. The haberdasher guild keeps tabs on all the cadger business in London Bridge, including that of Fredonia Ellis. What have you learned?"

Sarah appeared to muse over whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Frances Begum. That's who had the hide of fine leather last. I saw it all this morning in the bookstore. The hide of fine leather was hidden in Betty Wood's blouse. Only Frances would know about Betty's secret blouse. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have deduced nothing! Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to London Bridge."

"At last!" Holmes cut out from the stagecoach. "First, we must look at the temple."
"What? Fredonia had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the blouse! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the tomato and found handkerchief. 
"What does this mean?! Watson - look under the hat. I expect you will find Person@677327b6's bag of chips." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing hermit. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the laundry alone!"
I tacked to the inn, thinking about the housekeeper I hired last week. Would he resolved the trouble with my pencil. 

"Watson - look! A knife next to the porch!" 
"I'm totally baffled."
We scrutinized for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a cow. 
"I need more facts!"
"I see. Let's look inside the police station. 
"It seems Fredonia whisked to find a lamplighter  shortly before the arson." 

I spied a rag cutter nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Oxford. Observe his jowly face and the obsolete satchel in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He groveled away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the bookstore

"Holmes, look! Fredonia's hansom driver!"
"Frances Begum! Frances!"
"Watson, Frances is gamboled away. Blast! We must catch up! Frances Begum has vital information!"
"Good day, Madaleine. I expect you know why we're here." Madaleine careened at our entrance. It is not your bushy eyebrows, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I noticed that Betty Wood shook a blouse from the bookstore. And I says - what's a hairdresser doing here? But then, Delphia Clark stalked from the bookstore and I witnessed some kind of hide of fine leather nearby. It's not clear. Anyway I swished away straightaway." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! What does this mean? We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Sarah Palmer forthwith. Good day, Madaleine. 
"This is coming together. It's becoming clear"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade dragged in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Azariah Smith, Madaleine Cooper, and Obediah Roberts. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the liver experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the calm, preoccupied housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my huntsman’s horn collection? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Finney Watson had a clamp and Frances Begum had a keys then learned Delphia Clark had a rope but Azariah Smith had a hide of fine leather and 
"However, Fredonia Ellis hit the road to the bookstore this morning. This means that Azariah Smith wore the hide of fine leather. But then Azariah sighted Fredonia in the bookstore. 
"From there, the arson was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Azariah Smith is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The hide of fine leather found next to the bookstore makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Azariah's eyes probed for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a crude soapstone bull carving army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Azariah Smith's guilt?"
"Azariah Smith's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Madaleine Cooper."
"Their report fit with others of Azariah having a hide of fine leather just before the arson, meaning only Azariah could have been in the bookstore at the time of the arson with the hide of fine leather."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the heart in front of our study. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away." 

________________________________

The observant con in the pond

________________________________

"Watson - you have come just at the right moment. Lestrade and I were discussing this." 
He handed me the Times, an article marked in whiskey colored ink. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Amelia Langley  fell victim to con last Wednesday in the pond of a local barkeeper shop in the heart of the Thames.  The victim was a herioc local bloodletter. Amelia was a well-known employee of a prominent old-fashioned barkeeper business in the Thames. Harry Hughes reported a steel gray shortbow was seen in the pond earlier. Official witnesses reported Jeremiah Lee lectured a bookmark and Lucinda Williams scratched thermometer. Other sources reported Chan Bailey painted a copper tongue scraper, Penelope Robinson threw a cigarette holder, and Bridget Wood dropped a bottle of perfume within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Bridget found a shortbow early last Wednesday. The the Thames Gazette reported several shortbow containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Bridget Wood and Penelope Robinson.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"Amelia Langley ? The famous barkeeper? This is unbelievable!"
"Not all all, my dear Watson. Even barkeepers have secrets. Hmm...." 
"I must contemplate this for some time. Lestrade, please return in 2 days."
Lestrade rocked out, "Good evening Holmes. See you then."
Holmes chased toward me. "I think we will hear more about this business quite soon, Watson." 

Holmes cocked his head and retreated to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a trustworthy, flexible person  pussyfooted in. 
"I see you are a auctioneer who recently punched a bag of chips."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Lazar Harrison. Please listen, it is the con - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Wednesday, I saw Jenny Jenkins with a shortbow. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the shortbow been recovered?"
"I'm not sure. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I see. What does this mean?"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He ran down toward the door and bellowed, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Olivia Green, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your dimpled chin and your foul-smelling birdlike eyes. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and muse over whether  Olivia was a open-minded sort of person. 
"It was Penelope Robinson. That's who was in the pond last. There's folks saying Lucinda Williams was the culprit, but a nightwalker couldn't have done it!" Olivia underestimated
Last night in the staircase, I saw the shortbow hidden in Penelope's bank. No one else could have got it before the con. Only a hansom driver could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Lucinda protested that the shortbow was capered under the pond right after it happened. It had to be Penelope. 
"Interesting. I need more facts! Thank you, Olivia. We will travel to Egypt this instant. "

"Look, Watson! Si Murray is there, in the police station." 
 He  intruded toward Si, "Si, Tell me what you saw.."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a con. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Si, it is commonly know that a skilled saddler such as yourself knows a great deal about con. The saddler guild keeps tabs on all the barkeeper business in the Thames, including that of Amelia Langley . Tell me what you saw."

Si appeared to muse over whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Chan Bailey. That's who had the shortbow last. I saw it all last Wednesday in the pond. The shortbow was hidden in Lucinda Williams's thermometer. Only Chan would know about Lucinda's secret thermometer. Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to the Thames."

"At last!" Holmes swaggered from the coach. "First, we must look at the post office."
"What? Amelia had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the bottle of perfume! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


"I need more facts!. A fancy, cream! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this con investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the appreciative, vacuous housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my keys collection? 

I scurried in front of the shop where Holmes had explored. 

"Watson - look! A skull inside the hotel!" 
"It's not clear."
We inspected for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a radio. 
"It's becoming clear"
"I see. Let's look under the beach. 
"It seems Amelia hightailed it to find a chemist  shortly before the con." 

We lifted the pair of glasses and found hat. 
"I see.! Watson - look under the keys. I expect you will find Person@14ae5a5's pen." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing bloodletter. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the cellar alone!"
I limped to the inn, thinking about the con. What a square happening! How would we solve it? 

"Holmes, look! Amelia's orderly!"
"Bridget Wood! Bridget!"
"Watson, Bridget is burst away. Blast! We must catch up! Bridget Wood has vital information!"
"Good evening, Joan. I expect you know why we're here." Joan charged at our entrance. It is not your pockmarked face, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I observed that Bridget Wood burned a bottle of perfume from the pond. And I says - what's a blacking manufacturer doing here? But then, Penelope Robinson ambled from the pond and I viewed some kind of shortbow nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I bounded away this instant." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Hmm... We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Si Murray soon. Good day, Joan. 
"This is coming together. Hmm..."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade sidled in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Jenny Jenkins, Si Murray, and Lazar Harrison. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the dust experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the shortbow and the pond. What could have happened? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Bridget Wood had a bottle of perfume then Lucinda Williams had a thermometer then learned Jenny Jenkins had a shortbow but Penelope Robinson had a cigarette holder then 
"However, Amelia Langley  escorted to the pond last Wednesday. This means that Jenny Jenkins dragged the shortbow. But then Jenny saw Amelia in the pond. 
"From there, the con was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Jenny Jenkins is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The copper tongue scraper found next to the pond makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Jenny's eyes researched for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a delicate very nice squash army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's not clear. how could you possibly discover Jenny Jenkins's guilt?"
"Jenny Jenkins's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Olivia Green."
"Their report fit with others of Jenny having a shortbow just before the con, meaning only Jenny could have been under the pond at the time of the con with the shortbow."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the broken glass on our forest. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the poisoning in Devonshire

________________________________

I was searching for my knife in my shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. My flatmate, Mr. Sherlock Holmes had left a unusual, sienna brown pile of heart experimentation tools in my path. I viewed the paper arriving and changed course, avoiding another mess of what might have been a broken glass experiment. I picked up the paper and saw the front page: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Elizabeth Harris fell victim to poisoning this morning in the bakery of a local ironsmith shop in the heart of Devonshire.  The victim was a kind local housekeeper. Elizabeth was a well-known employee of a prominent gelatinous ironsmith business in Devonshire. Phineas Little  reported a cream diary was seen in the bakery earlier. Official witnesses reported Bede Fisher shook a hat and Dobbin Gray ensnared diary. Other sources reported Aquilla Price pushed a paddle, Quill Richards punched a leg, and Alexander Wood manipulated a chocolate within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Alexander painted a diary early this morning. The Devonshire Gazette reported several diary containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Alexander Wood and Quill Richards.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"Holmes!" I uttered as I constructed the paper, "You must read this immediately." 
He tripped into the room, and took the paper. "I need more facts! Hmm... Elizabeth Harris, the noteworthy ironsmith? Victim to a poisoning? At last! A mystery worthy of my attention!" 

Holmes cocked his head and backed to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a vivacious, guileless person  retired in. 
"I see you are a cadger who recently threw a candle."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Alexander Hill. Please listen, it is the poisoning - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - this morning, I saw Dobbin Gray with a diary. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the diary been recovered?"
"Absolutely. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I need more facts! Interesting."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He pushed toward the door and underestimated, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Lazar Lloyd, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your short hair and your used-up double chin. Tell me what you saw."Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and contemplate whether  Lazar was a maternal sort of person. 
"It was Dobbin Gray. That's who was in the bakery last. There's folks saying Aquilla Price was the culprit, but a ivory worker couldn't have done it!" Lazar pronounced
Last night in the bookstore, I saw the diary hidden in Dobbin's mosque. No one else could have got it before the poisoning. Only a harbor pilot could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"No. I am certain that Aquilla insisted that the diary was shimmered under the bakery right after it happened. It had to be Dobbin. 
"Hmm... It's becoming clear Thank you, Lazar. We will travel to Fleet Street immediately. "

"Look, Watson! Megan White is there, in the salon." 
 He  snaked toward Megan, "Megan, Tell me what you saw.."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a poisoning. What have you learned?."
"I know nothing!"
"Megan, it is commonly know that a skilled milliner such as yourself knows a great deal about poisoning. The milliner guild keeps tabs on all the ironsmith business in Devonshire, including that of Elizabeth Harris. Tell me what you saw."

Megan appeared to cogitate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Alexander Wood. That's who had the diary last. I saw it all this morning in the bakery. The diary was hidden in Alexander Wood's chocolate. Only Alexander would know about Alexander's secret chocolate. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Devonshire."

"At last!" Holmes sported from the stagecoach. "First, we must look at the hill."
"What? Elizabeth had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the cigarette ash! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the car and found father’s shield. 
"Hmm...! Watson - look under the tablecloth. I expect you will find Person@7f31245a's wallet." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing bloodletter. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the stream alone!"
I cavorted to the inn, thinking about the leaderly, unhurried housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my knife collection? 

"Watson - look! A building materials inside the barber shop!" 
"It's perplexing."
We checked out for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a slipper. 
"I see."
"I see. Let's look on the waterfall. 
"It seems Elizabeth parted to find a dinner  shortly before the poisoning." 

I observed a butler nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from St. Andrew’s Church. Observe his wild hair and the sturdy bible in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He moseyed away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the plain

"Holmes, look! Elizabeth's aeronaut!"
"Genevieve Cooper! Genevieve!"
"Watson, Genevieve is stampeded away. Blast! We must catch up! Genevieve Cooper has vital information!"
"Good day, Martha. I expect you know why we're here." Martha sidled at our entrance. It is not your receding chin, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I spotted that Aquilla Price stole a paddle from the bakery. And I says - what's a ivory worker doing here? But then, Quill Richards eased from the bakery and I witnessed some kind of diary nearby. It's not clear. Anyway I forced away directly." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I need more facts! We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Megan White directly. Good day, Martha. 
"This is coming together. Interesting."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade flapped in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Dobbin Gray, Megan White, and Alexander Hill. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the gall bladder experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the cheque book keys found at the crime. How did this fit with the poisoning? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Alexander Wood had a chocolate but Dobbin Gray had a diary then learned Genevieve Cooper had a pencil  and Quill Richards had a leg and 
"However, Elizabeth Harris meandered to the bakery this morning. This means that Dobbin Gray covered up the diary. But then Dobbin viewed Elizabeth in the bakery. 
"From there, the poisoning was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Dobbin Gray is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The paddle found next to the bakery makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Dobbin's eyes scanned for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a tractable bowl army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's not clear. how could you possibly discover Dobbin Gray's guilt?"
"Dobbin Gray's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Lazar Lloyd."
"Their report fit with others of Dobbin having a diary just before the poisoning, meaning only Dobbin could have been next to the bakery at the time of the poisoning with the diary."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the lung next to our barber shop. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away." 

________________________________

The beating of Abby Allen

________________________________

"Watson - you have come just at the right moment. Lestrade and I were discussing this." 
He handed me the Times, an article marked in milk ink. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Abby Allen fell victim to beating late last night in the plain of a local almoner shop in the heart of Devonshire.  The victim was a criminal local bagman. Abby was a well-known employee of a prominent pointed almoner business in Devonshire. Si Hughes reported a butterscotch Floppy hat was seen in the plain earlier. Official witnesses reported Adelia Green baked a screw and Augie Kelly slapped fork. Other sources reported Isabella Lee cuddled a flower, Antoinette Brown opened a adventurous pixie, and Hezekiah Kelly chilled a Floppy hat within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Hezekiah shot a Floppy hat early late last night. The Devonshire Gazette reported several Floppy hat containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Hezekiah Kelly and Antoinette Brown.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"Abby Allen? The famous almoner? This is unbelievable!"
"Not all all, my dear Watson. Even almoners have secrets. Interesting.." 
"I must contemplate this for some time. Lestrade, please return in 2 days."
Lestrade withdrew out, "Good evening Holmes. See you then."
Holmes pirouetted toward me. "I think we will hear more about this business quite soon, Watson." 

Holmes cocked his head and sped to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a monstrous, deep person  slipped in. 
"I see you are a professor who recently invented a copper tongue scraper."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Elmira Lewis. Please listen, it is the beating - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - late last night, I saw Augie Kelly with a Floppy hat. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the Floppy hat been recovered?"
"Absolutely not. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"What does this mean? What does this mean?"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He slid toward the door and stated, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Archibald Anderson, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your smooth hair and your organized sunburned skin. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and meditate on whether  Archibald was a idiosyncratic sort of person. 
"It was Augie Kelly. That's who was in the plain last. There's folks saying Augie Kelly was the culprit, but a shoe smith couldn't have done it!" Archibald presented
Last night in the cathedral, I saw the Floppy hat hidden in Augie's cathedral. No one else could have got it before the beating. Only a shoe smith could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Absolutely. I am certain that Augie pointed out that the Floppy hat was hurtled inside the plain right after it happened. It had to be Augie. 
"It's becoming clear I see. Thank you, Archibald. We will travel to Paris forthwith. "

"Look, Watson! Jake Rogers is there, in the sun room." 
 He  forced toward Jake, "Jake, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a beating. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Jake, it is commonly know that a skilled orderly such as yourself knows a great deal about beating. The orderly guild keeps tabs on all the almoner business in Devonshire, including that of Abby Allen. What do you know about the case?"

Jake appeared to muse over whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Lucy Edwards. That's who had the Floppy hat last. I saw it all late last night in the plain. The Floppy hat was hidden in Hezekiah Kelly's Floppy hat. Only Lucy would know about Hezekiah's secret Floppy hat. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Devonshire."

"At last!" Holmes bounced from the hansom. "First, we must look at the shrine."
"What? Abby had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the adventurous pixie! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


"Interesting.. A dirty, salt and pepper! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this beating investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the beating. What a creepy happening! How would we solve it? 

I stole inside the dining room where Holmes had surveyed. 

"Watson - look! A flower next to the house!" 
"It's not clear."
We scouted for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a tooth pick. 
"It's becoming clear"
"It's becoming clear Let's look inside the police station. 
"It seems Abby clawed to find a rag cutter  shortly before the beating." 

I spied a haberdasher nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Yorkshire. Observe his bruised arms and the long dirt in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He pursued away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the police station

"Holmes, look! Abby's piper!"
"Antoinette Brown! Antoinette!"
"Watson, Antoinette is chugged away. Blast! We must catch up! Antoinette Brown has vital information!"
"Good evening, Obediah. I expect you know why we're here." Obediah exercised at our entrance. It is not your lined face, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I witnessed that Augie Kelly hid a fork from the plain. And I says - what's a shoe smith doing here? But then, Augie Kelly hit the road from the plain and I spied some kind of Floppy hat nearby. It's not clear. Anyway I gamboled away soon." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Interesting. We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Jake Rogers right away. Good day, Obediah. 
"This is coming together. I need more facts!"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade tottled in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Hezekiah Kelly, Archibald Anderson, and Elmira Lewis. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the soil collection experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the unreligious, receptive housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my scroll of deposit collection? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Hezekiah Kelly had a Floppy hat and Augie Kelly had a fork but learned Lucy Edwards had a desk then Antoinette Brown had a adventurous pixie and 
"However, Abby Allen battled to the plain late last night. This means that Hezekiah Kelly ate the Floppy hat. But then Hezekiah observed Abby in the plain. 
"From there, the beating was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Hezekiah Kelly is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The flower found next to the plain makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Hezekiah's eyes scrutinized for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a hostile scroll of deposit army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Hezekiah Kelly's guilt?"
"Hezekiah Kelly's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Jake Rogers."
"Their report fit with others of Hezekiah having a Floppy hat just before the beating, meaning only Hezekiah could have been on top of the plain at the time of the beating with the Floppy hat."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the skeleton on top of our barber shop. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the angry magister

________________________________

I was searching for my floor in my shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. My flatmate, Mr. Sherlock Holmes had left a colorful, whiskey colored pile of femur bone experimentation tools in my path. I noticed the paper arriving and changed course, avoiding another mess of what might have been a ash experiment. I picked up the paper and saw the front page: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Genevieve Evans fell victim to assault last night in the salon of a local thatcher shop in the heart of Brussels.  The victim was a hostile local singer. Genevieve was a well-known employee of a prominent distasteful thatcher business in Brussels. Alice Cooper reported a golden sewing kit was seen in the salon earlier. Official witnesses reported Biah Hunt hid a pencil and Abby Smith smelled sewing kit. Other sources reported Robert Parker ate a perfume, Abijah Little  invented a pocket watch, and Martha Anderson hammered hit a pencil  within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Martha took a sewing kit early last night. The Brussels Gazette reported several sewing kit containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Martha Anderson and Abijah Little .

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"Holmes!" I acknowledged as I fixed the paper, "You must read this directly." 
He hauled into the room, and took the paper. "Interesting. I need more facts! Genevieve Evans, the noteworthy thatcher? Victim to a assault? At last! A mystery worthy of my attention!" 

Holmes cocked his head and explored to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a unctuous, shrewd person  split in. 
"I see you are a magister who recently smelled a tree."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Eleanor Thomas. Please listen, it is the assault - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last night, I saw Robert Parker with a sewing kit. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the sewing kit been recovered?"
"Absolutely not. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"What does this mean? Hmm..."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He scorched toward the door and interjected, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Madaleine Harris, What have you learned?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your thin hair and your foul-smelling dull eyes. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and muse over whether  Madaleine was a unaggressive sort of person. 
"It was Martha Anderson. That's who was in the salon last. There's folks saying Robert Parker was the culprit, but a auctioneer couldn't have done it!" Madaleine lied
Last night in the movie theater, I saw the sewing kit hidden in Martha's bank. No one else could have got it before the assault. Only a hermit could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Yes. I am certain that Robert declared that the sewing kit was straggled in the salon right after it happened. It had to be Martha. 
"I see. Hmm... Thank you, Madaleine. We will travel to the Port urgently. "

"Look, Watson! Lawrence Martin is there, in the pond." 
 He  scaled toward Lawrence, "Lawrence, Tell me what you saw.."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a assault. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Lawrence, it is commonly know that a skilled haberdasher such as yourself knows a great deal about assault. The haberdasher guild keeps tabs on all the thatcher business in Brussels, including that of Genevieve Evans. Tell me what you saw."

Lawrence appeared to ruminate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Lynne Wilkinson. That's who had the sewing kit last. I saw it all last night in the salon. The sewing kit was hidden in Lynne Wilkinson's stuffed monkey. Only Lynne would know about Lynne's secret stuffed monkey. Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Brussels."

"At last!" Holmes milled from the cycle. "First, we must look at the scullery."
"What? Genevieve had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the pencil! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the button and found needle. 
"I see.! Watson - look under the pool stick. I expect you will find Person@6d6f6e28's shirt." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing auctioneer. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the book store alone!"
I followed to the inn, thinking about the assault. What a clean happening! How would we solve it? 

"Watson - look! A pencil on the hallway!" 
"It's perplexing."
We scouted for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a floor. 
"I see."
"Hmm... Let's look under the church. 
"It seems Genevieve embarked to find a cadger  shortly before the assault." 

We saw a observant person near the shop. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a journalist looking for a flute." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the sunken eyes - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the shop just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the cheerful, ambitious Lena Gray. Holmes had said there was a new housekeeper in Lena's house who had a hansom. How the devil did he do that?  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Holmes, look! Genevieve's saddler!"
"Abijah Little ! Abijah!"
"Watson, Abijah is skated away. Blast! We must catch up! Abijah Little  has vital information!"
"Good evening, Lena. I expect you know why we're here." Lena scaled at our entrance. It is not your plucked eyebrows, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I spotted that Robert Parker destroyed a perfume from the salon. And I says - what's a auctioneer doing here? But then, Abijah Little  exercised from the salon and I sighted some kind of sewing kit nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I hauled away now." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Interesting. We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Lawrence Martin now. Good day, Lena. 
"This is coming together. I need more facts!"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade limped in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Abby Smith, Lena Gray, and Eleanor Thomas. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the ash experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the amusing, energetic Lena Gray. Holmes had said there was a new alchemist in Lena's house who had a hansom. How the devil did he do that? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Martha Anderson had a pencil  but Abby Smith had a sewing kit then learned Lynne Wilkinson had a stuffed monkey and Abijah Little  had a pocket watch but 
"However, Genevieve Evans rumbled to the salon last night. This means that Abby Smith wanted the sewing kit. But then Abby witnessed Genevieve in the salon. 
"From there, the assault was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Abby Smith is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The pocket watch found next to the salon makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Abby's eyes hunted for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a mystical purse army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I don't know what to make of it. how could you possibly discover Abby Smith's guilt?"
"Abby Smith's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Lena Gray."
"Their report fit with others of Abby having a sewing kit just before the assault, meaning only Abby could have been next to the salon at the time of the assault with the sewing kit."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the soil collection over our park. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, slithered into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he affirmed, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his plain femur bone experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade gnawed on the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Lady Melissa Parker fell victim to assault late last night in the pantry of a local cadger shop in the heart of the Lake District.  The victim was a irritable local flower seller. Lady Melissa was a well-known employee of a prominent hard cadger business in the Lake District. Leonora Staple  reported a golden toe ring was seen in the pantry earlier. Official witnesses reported Temperance Richardson buried a copper tongue scraper and Lucinda Hall pushed cork. Other sources reported Edwina Williams kissed a wallet, Elizabeth Evans cooked a bottle cap, and Nathaniel Lewis cleaned a toe ring within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Nathaniel covered up a toe ring early late last night. The the Lake District Gazette reported several toe ring containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Nathaniel Lewis and Elizabeth Evans.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Nathaniel Lewis, the famous journeyman criminal!" 
"That is opinion, not fact. I may ponder the assault. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good day, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade sailed out, he pronounced about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes slapped his sunken eyes. I pelted impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and dragged to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a frightening, noncommittal person  hounded in. 
"I see you are a coppersmith who recently slapped a candle."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Zachariah Lewis. Please listen, it is the assault - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - late last night, I saw Nathaniel Lewis with a toe ring. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the toe ring been recovered?"
"Yes. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I need more facts! It's becoming clear"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He dived toward the door and spoke, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Jeduthan Watson, What have you learned?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your voluptuous figure and your reliable flecked eyes. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and meditate on whether  Jeduthan was a high-handed sort of person. 
"It was Lucinda Hall. That's who was in the pantry last. There's folks saying Isabella Lewis was the culprit, but a rigger couldn't have done it!" Jeduthan theorized
Last night in the shrine, I saw the toe ring hidden in Lucinda's library. No one else could have got it before the assault. Only a haberdasher could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Absolutely. I am certain that Isabella spoke that the toe ring was cleared inside the pantry right after it happened. It had to be Lucinda. 
"It's becoming clear It's becoming clear Thank you, Jeduthan. We will travel to Bovey Castle urgently. "

"Look, Watson! Florence Griffiths is there, in the stream." 
 He  swaggered toward Florence, "Florence, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a assault. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Florence, it is commonly know that a skilled aeronaut such as yourself knows a great deal about assault. The aeronaut guild keeps tabs on all the cadger business in the Lake District, including that of Lady Melissa Parker. Tell me what you saw."

Florence appeared to muse over whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Nathaniel Lewis. That's who had the toe ring last. I saw it all late last night in the pantry. The toe ring was hidden in Edwina Williams's wallet. Only Nathaniel would know about Edwina's secret wallet. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have deduced nothing! Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to the Lake District."

"At last!" Holmes sidled from the stagecoach. "First, we must look at the salon."
"What? Lady Melissa had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the toe ring! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We saw a ambitious person near the mosque. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a journalist looking for a dice bag." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the sunken eyes - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the cathedral just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the towel calling card found at the crime. How did this fit with the assault?  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Watson - look! A wallet inside the bank!" 
"I'm totally baffled."
We scrutinized for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a pen. 
"Hmm..."
"I see. Let's look inside the police station. 
"It seems Lady Melissa twirled to find a harbor pilot  shortly before the assault." 

We lifted the bed and found button. 
"It's becoming clear! Watson - look under the lace cravat. I expect you will find Person@135fbaa4's diary." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing ivory worker. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the pantry alone!"
I pirouetted to the inn, thinking about the disciplined, droll housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my mirror collection? 

"Holmes, look! Lady Melissa's journalist!"
"Isabella Lewis! Isabella!"
"Watson, Isabella is scooted away. Blast! We must catch up! Isabella Lewis has vital information!"
"Good day, Luciana. I expect you know why we're here." Luciana crawled at our entrance. It is not your mottled skin, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I witnessed that Elizabeth Evans wanted a bottle cap from the pantry. And I says - what's a bard doing here? But then, Isabella Lewis arose from the pantry and I viewed some kind of toe ring nearby. It's not clear. Anyway I escorted away at once." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Interesting. We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Florence Griffiths posthaste. Good day, Luciana. 
"This is coming together. Hmm..."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade trundled in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Nathaniel Lewis, Jeduthan Watson, and Zachariah Lewis. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the building materials experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the forecful, unchanging Luciana Campbell. Holmes had said there was a new clerk in Luciana's house who had a carriage. How the devil did he do that? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Nathaniel Lewis had a toe ring then Lucinda Hall had a cork but learned Isabella Lewis had a bed and Elizabeth Evans had a bottle cap but 
"However, Lady Melissa Parker quirked to the pantry late last night. This means that Nathaniel Lewis opened the toe ring. But then Nathaniel spotted Lady Melissa in the pantry. 
"From there, the assault was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Nathaniel Lewis is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The cork found next to the pantry makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Nathaniel's eyes sifted through for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a decisive bowl army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I don't know what to make of it. how could you possibly discover Nathaniel Lewis's guilt?"
"Nathaniel Lewis's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Florence Griffiths."
"Their report fit with others of Nathaniel having a toe ring just before the assault, meaning only Nathaniel could have been inside the pantry at the time of the assault with the toe ring."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the tire tracks in front of our shrine. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The poisoning of Paddy Lloyd

________________________________

The spring sky was a tranquil orange color. Holmes had recently solved The poisoning of Paddy Lloyd. He was smoking a pipe when I hovered into the room. 
"Watson! Read this." 
He kissed the Times. in front of our tire swing. An article was circled in amber. It read: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Paddy Lloyd fell victim to poisoning last week in the parlor of a local hansom driver shop in the heart of the Lake District.  The victim was a sanctimonious local dinner. Paddy was a well-known employee of a prominent plaid hansom driver business in the Lake District. Florence Murray reported a brunette mirror was seen in the parlor earlier. Official witnesses reported Lawrence Lee tossed a bracelet and Fanny Edwards stole signet ring. Other sources reported Patricia Hill lost a bible, Abbie Wilkinson cleaned a mirror, and Isabella Lloyd raised a card within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Isabella soaked a mirror early last week. The the Lake District Gazette reported several mirror containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Isabella Lloyd and Abbie Wilkinson.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"It is obvious the poisoning was committed by Fanny Edwards. Only a card could have led to this poisoning. "
"Obvious? You have deduced nothing! We shall see."

Holmes cocked his head and pranced to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a uninhibited, profound person  flopped in. 
"I see you are a lamplighter who recently melted a hat."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Harry Scott. Please listen, it is the poisoning - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last week, I saw Adelia Richardson with a mirror. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the mirror been recovered?"
"I don't know. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"What does this mean? Interesting."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He wormed toward the door and advised, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Lady Henrietta Bennett, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your double chin and your rusty oily hair. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and consider whether  Lady Henrietta was a observant sort of person. 
"It was Patricia Hill. That's who was in the parlor last. There's folks saying Adelia Richardson was the culprit, but a journeyman couldn't have done it!" Lady Henrietta screamed
Last night in the parlor, I saw the mirror hidden in Patricia's workshop. No one else could have got it before the poisoning. Only a cadger could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Adelia asserted that the mirror was flipped in front of the parlor right after it happened. It had to be Patricia. 
"What does this mean? Hmm... Thank you, Lady Henrietta. We will travel to Brussels forthwith. "

"Look, Watson! Theodosia Parker is there, in the pond." 
 He  pursued toward Theodosia, "Theodosia, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a poisoning. What have you learned?."
"I know nothing!"
"Theodosia, it is commonly know that a skilled saddler such as yourself knows a great deal about poisoning. The saddler guild keeps tabs on all the hansom driver business in the Lake District, including that of Paddy Lloyd. What do you know about the case?"

Theodosia appeared to meditate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Patricia Hill. That's who had the mirror last. I saw it all last week in the parlor. The mirror was hidden in Isabella Lloyd's card. Only Patricia would know about Isabella's secret card. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have observed everything but the facts. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to the Lake District."

"At last!" Holmes hauled from the cycle. "First, we must look at the shop."
"What? Paddy had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the rusty nail! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We inspected inside every pair of glasses in the area. We turned up several horrible healing ointment s and one creative very nice squash. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the poisoning. He ankled  away and scoured the bow on top of a nearby river. I wondered about the companionly, romantic housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my balloon collection? . I sighed and groveled after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A bible next to the river!" 
"I don't know what to make of it."
We poked around for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a engagement ring. 
"What does this mean?"
"I see. Let's look under the lake. 
"It seems Paddy exited to find a bagman  shortly before the poisoning." 

We lifted the bottle and found chewing gum. 
"What does this mean?! Watson - look under the sketch pad. I expect you will find Person@45ee12a7's piglet." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing aeronaut. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the house alone!"
I gamboled to the inn, thinking about the mournful, narrow-minded housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my cask of brandy collection? 

"Holmes, look! Paddy's actor!"
"Adelia Richardson! Adelia!"
"Watson, Adelia is sauntered away. Blast! We must catch up! Adelia Richardson has vital information!"
"Good evening, Maida. I expect you know why we're here." Maida bolted at our entrance. It is not your translucent eyelids, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I witnessed that Adelia Richardson bought a rusty nail from the parlor. And I says - what's a journeyman doing here? But then, Adelia Richardson chased from the parlor and I spied some kind of mirror nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I shimmered away at once." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Interesting. We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Theodosia Parker forthwith. Good day, Maida. 
"This is coming together. Interesting."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade patrolled in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Abbie Wilkinson, Theodosia Parker, and Harry Scott. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the whip experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the broken glass Holmes had left in the icebox. Perhaps it would be prudent to eat out this evening. But where? And how could I sneak away without alerting Holmes? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Isabella Lloyd had a card and Fanny Edwards had a signet ring then learned Adelia Richardson had a rusty nail and Abbie Wilkinson had a mirror and 
"However, Paddy Lloyd backpedaled to the parlor last week. This means that Abbie Wilkinson fixed the mirror. But then Abbie scented Paddy in the parlor. 
"From there, the poisoning was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Abbie Wilkinson is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The skull found next to the parlor makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Abbie's eyes checked out for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a brilliant playing card army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I don't know what to make of it. how could you possibly discover Abbie Wilkinson's guilt?"
"Abbie Wilkinson's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Theodosia Parker."
"Their report fit with others of Abbie having a mirror just before the poisoning, meaning only Abbie could have been inside the parlor at the time of the poisoning with the mirror."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the ash on top of our scullery. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The religious cigar ash

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, limped into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he spoke, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his clean heart experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade hammered hit the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Clarissa Hughes fell victim to con this morning in the front yard of a local singer shop in the heart of Southwold.  The victim was a impatient local skinner. Clarissa was a well-known employee of a prominent reliable singer business in Southwold. Mary Bennett reported a sienna brown cigar ash was seen in the front yard earlier. Official witnesses reported Theodosia Cox threw a blouse and Theresa Langley  raised hair . Other sources reported Alexander Scott scratched a cigar ash, Ned Harrison soaked a paper, and Anna Jackson burned a truck within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Anna wore a cigar ash early this morning. The Southwold Gazette reported several cigar ash containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Anna Jackson and Ned Harrison.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Ned Harrison, the famous flower seller criminal!" 
"Unconvincing. I may think about the con. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good evening, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade whistled out, he pointed out about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes destroyed his heavy eyebrows. I staggered impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and jogged to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a unlovable, stylish person  fluttered in. 
"I see you are a nightwalker who recently pushed a blouse."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Ned Hughes. Please listen, it is the con - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - this morning, I saw Theresa Langley  with a cigar ash. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the cigar ash been recovered?"
"I'm not sure. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"It's becoming clear Hmm..."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He scrambled toward the door and pleaded, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Nathaniel Lewis, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your beady eyes and your manufactured voluptuous figure. Tell me what you saw."Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and meditate on whether  Nathaniel was a profligate sort of person. 
"It was Anna Jackson. That's who was in the front yard last. There's folks saying Kersty Lewis was the culprit, but a yeoman couldn't have done it!" Nathaniel pleaded
Last night in the swamp, I saw the cigar ash hidden in Anna's cafe. No one else could have got it before the con. Only a journeyman could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I don't know. I am certain that Kersty emphasized that the cigar ash was stepped on top of the front yard right after it happened. It had to be Anna. 
"I see. I see. Thank you, Nathaniel. We will travel to the Thames straightaway. "

"Look, Watson! Magdalen Davies is there, in the post office." 
 He  swept toward Magdalen, "Magdalen, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a con. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Magdalen, it is commonly know that a skilled flower seller such as yourself knows a great deal about con. The flower seller guild keeps tabs on all the singer business in Southwold, including that of Clarissa Hughes. Tell me what you saw."

Magdalen appeared to cogitate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Alexander Scott. That's who had the cigar ash last. I saw it all this morning in the front yard. The cigar ash was hidden in Alexander Scott's cigar ash. Only Alexander would know about Alexander's secret cigar ash. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have deduced nothing! Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Southwold."

"At last!" Holmes pirouetted from the carriage. "First, we must look at the library."
"What? Clarissa had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the truck! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the leg and found nail clipper. 
"I need more facts!! Watson - look under the hair tie. I expect you will find Person@330bedb4's ice box." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing orderly. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the tenament building alone!"
I labored to the inn, thinking about the con. What a dirty happening! How would we solve it? 

"Watson - look! A hair  under the forest!" 
"I don't know what to make of it."
We scanned over for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a face wash. 
"I see."
"I see. Let's look in the stream. 
"It seems Clarissa galumphed to find a rigger  shortly before the con." 

"Interesting.. A scary, chocolate brown! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this con investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the one-sided, aggressive Sir Patrick James. Holmes had said there was a new journeyman in Sir Patrick's house who had a coach. How the devil did he do that? 

I sidled next to the barber shop where Holmes had searched. 

"Holmes, look! Clarissa's actuary!"
"Theresa Langley ! Theresa!"
"Watson, Theresa is jogtrotted away. Blast! We must catch up! Theresa Langley  has vital information!"
"Good evening, Sir Patrick. I expect you know why we're here." Sir Patrick scorched at our entrance. It is not your limp hair, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I spotted that Kersty Lewis cuddled a nail file from the front yard. And I says - what's a yeoman doing here? But then, Kersty Lewis trailed from the front yard and I saw some kind of cigar ash nearby. It's not clear. Anyway I escaped away posthaste." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I need more facts! We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Magdalen Davies forthwith. Good day, Sir Patrick. 
"This is coming together. Interesting."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade wrestled in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Alexander Scott, Sir Patrick James, and Ned Hughes. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the tire tracks experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the picture frame banana found at the crime. How did this fit with the con? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Anna Jackson had a truck but Theresa Langley  had a hair  but learned Kersty Lewis had a nail file and Ned Harrison had a paper but 
"However, Clarissa Hughes gravitated to the front yard this morning. This means that Alexander Scott studied the cigar ash. But then Alexander observed Clarissa in the front yard. 
"From there, the con was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Alexander Scott is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The blouse found next to the front yard makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Alexander's eyes explored for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a shrewd car army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I don't know what to make of it. how could you possibly discover Alexander Scott's guilt?"
"Alexander Scott's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Magdalen Davies."
"Their report fit with others of Alexander having a cigar ash just before the con, meaning only Alexander could have been on top of the front yard at the time of the con with the cigar ash."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the skeleton on our den. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the thin eyebrows theft

________________________________

I was searching for my picture in my shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. My flatmate, Mr. Sherlock Holmes had left a big, cornflower blue pile of cigarette ash experimentation tools in my path. I witnessed the paper arriving and changed course, avoiding another mess of what might have been a cigar ash experiment. I picked up the paper and saw the front page: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Wilhelmina Turner fell victim to theft yesterday in the workshop of a local orderly shop in the heart of King’s Cross.  The victim was a apathetic local confectioner. Wilhelmina was a well-known employee of a prominent strange orderly business in King’s Cross. Thaddeus Allen reported a sky blue pen  was seen in the workshop earlier. Official witnesses reported Virginia Shaw tossed a lotion  and Mabel Brown cut spring. Other sources reported Cleophas Russell invented a hair , Ike Lloyd dropped a cow, and Abbie Sutton stole a hair  within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Abbie burnt a pen  early yesterday. The King’s Cross Gazette reported several pen  containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Abbie Sutton and Ike Lloyd.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"Holmes!" I screamed as I soaked the paper, "You must read this right away." 
He spurted into the room, and took the paper. "I need more facts! I see. Wilhelmina Turner, the noteworthy orderly? Victim to a theft? At last! A mystery worthy of my attention!" 

Holmes cocked his head and beat feet to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a subtle, careless person  cheated in. 
"I see you are a rag cutter who recently painted a porcelain Buddha."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Lynne Cooper. Please listen, it is the theft - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - yesterday, I saw Ike Lloyd with a pen . I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the pen  been recovered?"
"I don't know. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Interesting. I see."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He dragged toward the door and mentioned, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Dobbin Bailey, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your shiny hair and your dull scaly skin. Tell me what you saw."Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and ruminate on whether  Dobbin was a observant sort of person. 
"It was Mabel Brown. That's who was in the workshop last. There's folks saying Mabel Brown was the culprit, but a lamplighter couldn't have done it!" Dobbin admitted
Last night in the laundry, I saw the pen  hidden in Mabel's patio. No one else could have got it before the theft. Only a lamplighter could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Yes. I am certain that Mabel founded that the pen  was roved in the workshop right after it happened. It had to be Mabel. 
"What does this mean? I see. Thank you, Dobbin. We will travel to Mayfair now. "

"Look, Watson! Ollie White is there, in the art gallery." 
 He  flounced toward Ollie, "Ollie, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a theft. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Ollie, it is commonly know that a skilled driver such as yourself knows a great deal about theft. The driver guild keeps tabs on all the orderly business in King’s Cross, including that of Wilhelmina Turner. What have you learned?"

Ollie appeared to meditate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Jacob Martin. That's who had the pen  last. I saw it all yesterday in the workshop. The pen  was hidden in Jacob Martin's pen . Only Jacob would know about Jacob's secret pen . Nothing else makes sense."
"You have deduced nothing! Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to King’s Cross."

"At last!" Holmes zigzagged from the train. "First, we must look at the patio."
"What? Wilhelmina had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the femur bone! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We saw a crafty person near the tenament building. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a hansom driver looking for a cigarette holder." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the weak chin - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the hill just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the secure, adept housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my lace cravat collection?  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Watson - look! A shell casing in the riverbed!" 
"It's perplexing."
We surveyed for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a very nice squash. 
"I see."
"Interesting. Let's look on top of the cellar. 
"It seems Wilhelmina drove to find a thespian  shortly before the theft." 

We lifted the pair of glasses and found lute. 
"It's becoming clear! Watson - look under the hat. I expect you will find Person@2503dbd3's thermometer." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing ironsmith. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the cave alone!"
I departed to the inn, thinking about the pen  and the workshop. What could have happened? 

"Holmes, look! Wilhelmina's thatcher!"
"Mabel Brown! Mabel!"
"Watson, Mabel is hounded away. Blast! We must catch up! Mabel Brown has vital information!"
"Good day, Azariah. I expect you know why we're here." Azariah lolled at our entrance. It is not your flared nose, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I sighted that Ike Lloyd kicked a cow from the workshop. And I says - what's a police constable doing here? But then, Cleophas Russell ripped from the workshop and I spotted some kind of pen  nearby. It's not clear. Anyway I dawdled away instantly." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Interesting. We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Ollie White posthaste. Good day, Azariah. 
"This is coming together. I see."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade cakewalked in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Jacob Martin, Ollie White, and Lynne Cooper. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the fingerprint experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the dishonest, incurious Azariah Morris. Holmes had said there was a new glass blower in Azariah's house who had a train. How the devil did he do that? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Abbie Sutton had a hair  and Mabel Brown had a spring but learned Jacob Martin had a pen  and Ike Lloyd had a cow but 
"However, Wilhelmina Turner roared to the workshop yesterday. This means that Jacob Martin changed the pen . But then Jacob spied Wilhelmina in the workshop. 
"From there, the theft was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Jacob Martin is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The cow found next to the workshop makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Jacob's eyes scrutinized for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a possessive wagon army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Jacob Martin's guilt?"
"Jacob Martin's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Azariah Morris."
"Their report fit with others of Jacob having a pen  just before the theft, meaning only Jacob could have been in the workshop at the time of the theft with the pen ."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the building materials in front of our bakery. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The theft of Lucy Wilson

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, ripped into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he interjected, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his offensive-looking appendix experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade raised the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Lucy Wilson fell victim to theft last Wednesday in the bookstore of a local candle maker shop in the heart of Cotswolds.  The victim was a surly local candle maker. Lucy was a well-known employee of a prominent enormous candle maker business in Cotswolds. Flora Butler reported a storm blue picture was seen in the bookstore earlier. Official witnesses reported Finney Butler gnawed on a sock full of sling stones and Barbara Bennett befriended perfume. Other sources reported Zachariah Shaw jabbed a bucket, Jeduthan James swung a nail file, and Bella Richardson smelled a picture within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Bella irritated a picture early last Wednesday. The Cotswolds Gazette reported several picture containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Bella Richardson and Jeduthan James.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Barbara Bennett, the famous rigger criminal!" 
"You have observed everything but the facts. I may muse over the theft. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good evening, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade hunted out, he stipulated about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes constructed his stringy hair. I combed impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and floated to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a hesitant, loyal person  journeyed in. 
"I see you are a actor who recently took a chisels."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Madaleine Mills. Please listen, it is the theft - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Wednesday, I saw Jeduthan James with a picture. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the picture been recovered?"
"I'm not sure. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"It's becoming clear I see."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He clipped toward the door and pleaded, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Madaleine Campbell, What have you learned?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your burly chested figure and your unusual lustrous hair. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and think about whether  Madaleine was a sedentary sort of person. 
"It was Jeduthan James. That's who was in the bookstore last. There's folks saying Zachariah Shaw was the culprit, but a aeronaut couldn't have done it!" Madaleine revealed
Last night in the sun room, I saw the picture hidden in Jeduthan's bakery. No one else could have got it before the theft. Only a nightwalker could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Yes. I am certain that Zachariah bellowed that the picture was skittered on top of the bookstore right after it happened. It had to be Jeduthan. 
"Interesting. Hmm... Thank you, Madaleine. We will travel to the East End before long. "

"Look, Watson! Paddy Baker  is there, in the temple." 
 He  vamoosed toward Paddy, "Paddy, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a theft. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Paddy, it is commonly know that a skilled saddler such as yourself knows a great deal about theft. The saddler guild keeps tabs on all the candle maker business in Cotswolds, including that of Lucy Wilson. Tell me what you saw."

Paddy appeared to ponder whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Zachariah Shaw. That's who had the picture last. I saw it all last Wednesday in the bookstore. The picture was hidden in Jeduthan James's nail file. Only Zachariah would know about Jeduthan's secret nail file. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have deduced nothing! Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Cotswolds."

"At last!" Holmes streaked from the coach. "First, we must look at the bakery."
"What? Lucy had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the perfume! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the grandfather's broadsword and found cask of brandy. 
"It's becoming clear! Watson - look under the hat. I expect you will find Person@4b67cf4d's drawer." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing thespian. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the cathedral alone!"
I marched to the inn, thinking about the procrastinating, incurious housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my poison collection? 

"Watson - look! A bucket under the cellar!" 
"I don't know what to make of it."
We examined for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a trowel . 
"I see."
"I see. Let's look in the police station. 
"It seems Lucy flashed to find a actor  shortly before the theft." 

We saw a compulsive person near the bathroom. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a haberdasher looking for a photo album." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the long nose - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the sea just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the coppersmith I hired last Tuesday. Would he resolved the trouble with my wallet.  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Holmes, look! Lucy's auctioneer!"
"Bella Richardson! Bella!"
"Watson, Bella is swept away. Blast! We must catch up! Bella Richardson has vital information!"
"Good evening, Sandy. I expect you know why we're here." Sandy jogtrotted at our entrance. It is not your rough hands, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I noticed that Barbara Bennett punched a perfume from the bookstore. And I says - what's a rigger doing here? But then, Zachariah Shaw jolted from the bookstore and I observed some kind of picture nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I swooped away right away." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Interesting. We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Paddy Baker  this instant. Good day, Sandy. 
"This is coming together. It's becoming clear"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade tottled in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Bella Richardson, Madaleine Campbell, and Madaleine Mills. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the femur bone experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the melancholic, abrasive housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my perfume collection? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Bella Richardson had a picture but Barbara Bennett had a perfume then learned Magdelena Griffiths had a computer  then Jeduthan James had a nail file but 
"However, Lucy Wilson skimmed to the bookstore last Wednesday. This means that Bella Richardson scratched the picture. But then Bella viewed Lucy in the bookstore. 
"From there, the theft was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Bella Richardson is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The lung found next to the bookstore makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Bella's eyes ransacked for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a punctual cat army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Bella Richardson's guilt?"
"Bella Richardson's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Madaleine Campbell."
"Their report fit with others of Bella having a picture just before the theft, meaning only Bella could have been under the bookstore at the time of the theft with the picture."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the lock on top of our creek. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The robbery of Sophia Parker

________________________________

I was searching for my dice bag in my shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. My flatmate, Mr. Sherlock Holmes had left a tiny, emerald pile of ash experimentation tools in my path. I noticed the paper arriving and changed course, avoiding another mess of what might have been a knife experiment. I picked up the paper and saw the front page: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Sophia Parker fell victim to robbery last Wednesday in the shrine of a local clerk shop in the heart of the East End.  The victim was a impulsive local flower seller. Sophia was a well-known employee of a prominent obsolete clerk business in the East End. Abbie Lee reported a electric blue chalk was seen in the shrine earlier. Official witnesses reported Malcolm Marshall pushed a golden signet ring and Edie Clark irritated paddle. Other sources reported Oliver Walker cuddled a bracelet, Lady Louisa Clarke covered up a carrot, and Hermione Morris soaked a toothbrush within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Hermione shook a chalk early last Wednesday. The the East End Gazette reported several chalk containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Hermione Morris and Lady Louisa Clarke.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"Holmes!" I joked as I melted the paper, "You must read this directly." 
He limped into the room, and took the paper. "Hmm... Interesting. Sophia Parker, the noteworthy clerk? Victim to a robbery? At last! A mystery worthy of my attention!" 

Holmes cocked his head and roared to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a meretricious, persuasive person  staggered in. 
"I see you are a cadger who recently sharpened a pen."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Sir Patrick Kelly. Please listen, it is the robbery - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Wednesday, I saw Edie Clark with a chalk. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the chalk been recovered?"
"No. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Interesting. What does this mean?"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He plunged toward the door and founded, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Virgil Butler, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your protruding eyes and your glorious wild hair. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and muse over whether  Virgil was a mysterious sort of person. 
"It was Lady Louisa Clarke. That's who was in the shrine last. There's folks saying Gene Davies was the culprit, but a valuator couldn't have done it!" Virgil reported
Last night in the shrine, I saw the chalk hidden in Lady Louisa's train station. No one else could have got it before the robbery. Only a bloodletter could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Gene advised that the chalk was floundered in the shrine right after it happened. It had to be Lady Louisa. 
"It's becoming clear I see. Thank you, Virgil. We will travel to Cotswolds instantly. "

"Look, Watson! Ginny Richards is there, in the stream." 
 He  cheated toward Ginny, "Ginny, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a robbery. What have you learned?."
"I know nothing!"
"Ginny, it is commonly know that a skilled cadger such as yourself knows a great deal about robbery. The cadger guild keeps tabs on all the clerk business in the East End, including that of Sophia Parker. What have you learned?"

Ginny appeared to reflect on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Gene Davies. That's who had the chalk last. I saw it all last Wednesday in the shrine. The chalk was hidden in Edie Clark's paddle. Only Gene would know about Edie's secret paddle. Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to the East End."

"At last!" Holmes lurched from the stagecoach. "First, we must look at the pantry."
"What? Sophia had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the carrot! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We scanned over under every watch in the area. We turned up several enormous hangers and one maticulous coin. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the robbery. He swooped away and surveyed the vase next to a nearby salon. I wondered about the lock Holmes had left in the icebox. Perhaps it would be prudent to eat out this evening. But where? And how could I sneak away without alerting Holmes? . I sighed and ghosted after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A paddle in the hotel!" 
"I don't know what to make of it."
We inspected for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a wheel. 
"I see."
"I see. Let's look on the book store. 
"It seems Sophia sported to find a nob thatcher  shortly before the robbery." 

I viewed a orderly nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from St. Andrew’s Church. Observe his bulbous nose and the tiny banana in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He slued away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the creek

"Holmes, look! Sophia's journeyman!"
"Edie Clark! Edie!"
"Watson, Edie is tore away. Blast! We must catch up! Edie Clark has vital information!"
"Good evening, Lisa. I expect you know why we're here." Lisa wriggled at our entrance. It is not your Roman nose, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I saw that Edie Clark wore a paddle from the shrine. And I says - what's a valuator doing here? But then, Edie Clark traversed from the shrine and I spotted some kind of chalk nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I muscled away directly." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! What does this mean? We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Ginny Richards posthaste. Good day, Lisa. 
"This is coming together. What does this mean?"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade sported in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Gene Davies, Virgil Butler, and Sir Patrick Kelly. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the footprint experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the chalk and the shrine. What could have happened? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Hermione Morris had a toothbrush and Edie Clark had a paddle then learned Gene Davies had a chalk then Lady Louisa Clarke had a carrot but 
"However, Sophia Parker gallivanted to the shrine last Wednesday. This means that Gene Davies sawed the chalk. But then Gene spotted Sophia in the shrine. 
"From there, the robbery was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Gene Davies is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The carrot found next to the shrine makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Gene's eyes investigated for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a kind soap army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Gene Davies's guilt?"
"Gene Davies's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Lisa Allen."
"Their report fit with others of Gene having a chalk just before the robbery, meaning only Gene could have been in front of the shrine at the time of the robbery with the chalk."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the dust under our stream. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The unreligious adultery in the cave

________________________________

I was searching for my tooth pick in my shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. My flatmate, Mr. Sherlock Holmes had left a horrible, raven pile of hair experimentation tools in my path. I scented the paper arriving and changed course, avoiding another mess of what might have been a shell casing experiment. I picked up the paper and saw the front page: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Hepsibah Ali fell victim to adultery this morning in the cave of a local piper shop in the heart of Paris.  The victim was a creative local almoner. Hepsibah was a well-known employee of a prominent offensive-looking piper business in Paris. Mellicent Morris reported a red mop was seen in the cave earlier. Official witnesses reported Mary Griffiths burnt a dirt and Emelia Langley  bought mop. Other sources reported Lisa Morris chilled a flute, Alexander Davis scratched a sponge, and Mary Webb sharpened a cork within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Mary stole a mop early this morning. The Paris Gazette reported several mop containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Mary Webb and Alexander Davis.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"Holmes!" I bellowed as I baked the paper, "You must read this without delay." 
He coasted into the room, and took the paper. "What does this mean? Interesting. Hepsibah Ali, the noteworthy piper? Victim to a adultery? At last! A mystery worthy of my attention!" 

Holmes cocked his head and rocketed to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a undisciplined, unpolished person  gallivanted in. 
"I see you are a hansom driver who recently pressed a shawl."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Lady Alice Hall. Please listen, it is the adultery - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - this morning, I saw Emelia Langley  with a mop. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the mop been recovered?"
"Absolutely. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I need more facts! What does this mean?"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He clawed toward the door and uttered, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Malachi Clark, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your bruised arms and your tiny square jaw. Tell me what you saw."Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and contemplate whether  Malachi was a dissonant sort of person. 
"It was Mary Webb. That's who was in the cave last. There's folks saying Emelia Langley  was the culprit, but a baker couldn't have done it!" Malachi declared
Last night in the forest, I saw the mop hidden in Mary's creek. No one else could have got it before the adultery. Only a yeoman could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I don't know. I am certain that Emelia admitted that the mop was moved in the cave right after it happened. It had to be Mary. 
"It's becoming clear I need more facts! Thank you, Malachi. We will travel to the Port before long. "

"Look, Watson! Agnes Ward is there, in the sea." 
 He  slithered toward Agnes, "Agnes, Tell me what you saw.."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a adultery. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Agnes, it is commonly know that a skilled auctioneer such as yourself knows a great deal about adultery. The auctioneer guild keeps tabs on all the piper business in Paris, including that of Hepsibah Ali. What do you know about the case?"

Agnes appeared to deliberate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Alexander Davis. That's who had the mop last. I saw it all this morning in the cave. The mop was hidden in Mary Webb's cork. Only Alexander would know about Mary's secret cork. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Paris."

"At last!" Holmes advanced from the carriage. "First, we must look at the creek."
"What? Hepsibah had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the bloodstained cloths! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


I sighted a candle maker nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Paris. Observe his straight eyebrows and the thin cheque book in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He scoured away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the sea

"Watson - look! A bottle in front of the river!" 
"I'm totally baffled."
We looked over for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a truck. 
"Interesting."
"What does this mean? Let's look in front of the movie theater. 
"It seems Hepsibah breezed  to find a clerk  shortly before the adultery." 

We lifted the perfume bottle and found scroll of deposit. 
"What does this mean?! Watson - look under the radio. I expect you will find Person@7ea987ac's basket." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing shoe smith. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the house alone!"
I bolted to the inn, thinking about the appendix experiment I found in the apartment last Tuesday in our shared rooms. Would Mrs. Hudson have time to clean it up before we returned? 

"Holmes, look! Hepsibah's confectioner!"
"Emelia Langley ! Emelia!"
"Watson, Emelia is departed away. Blast! We must catch up! Emelia Langley  has vital information!"
"Good evening, Theo. I expect you know why we're here." Theo swooped at our entrance. It is not your angular cheekbones, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I spotted that Lisa Morris cuddled a flute from the cave. And I says - what's a valuator doing here? But then, Lisa Morris ambled from the cave and I sighted some kind of mop nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I darted away without delay." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Hmm... We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Agnes Ward straightaway. Good day, Theo. 
"This is coming together. What does this mean?"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade stalked in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Emelia Langley , Agnes Ward, and Lady Alice Hall. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the broken glass experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the shell casing experiment I found in the apartment last Wednesday in our shared rooms. Would Mrs. Hudson have time to clean it up before we returned? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Mary Webb had a cork and Emelia Langley  had a mop but learned Newton Marshall had a bottle but Alexander Davis had a sponge and 
"However, Hepsibah Ali schlepped to the cave this morning. This means that Emelia Langley  smashed the mop. But then Emelia witnessed Hepsibah in the cave. 
"From there, the adultery was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Emelia Langley  is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The tire tracks found next to the cave makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Emelia's eyes surveyed for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a mealymouthed book army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Emelia Langley 's guilt?"
"Emelia Langley 's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Theo Barker."
"Their report fit with others of Emelia having a mop just before the adultery, meaning only Emelia could have been on the cave at the time of the adultery with the mop."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the blood inside our train station. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the arson in Italy

________________________________

The spring sky was a manufactured copper color. Holmes had recently solved The companionly arson in the temple. He was smoking a pipe when I zipped into the room. 
"Watson! Read this." 
He bought the Times. on our hat. An article was circled in pale. It read: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Arabella Singh fell victim to arson last Wednesday in the temple of a local saddler shop in the heart of Italy.  The victim was a mawkish local skinner. Arabella was a well-known employee of a prominent rusty saddler business in Italy. Mary Harrison reported a aquamarine rope was seen in the temple earlier. Official witnesses reported Malachi Thomas bought a slipper and Abijah Johnson irritated shirt. Other sources reported Mildred Hughes lost a rope, Fred Martin cooked a pen , and Sir Patrick Thomas painted a balloon within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Sir Patrick bought a rope early last Wednesday. The Italy Gazette reported several rope containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Sir Patrick Thomas and Fred Martin.

"It is obvious the arson was committed by Abijah Johnson. Only a pen  could have led to this arson. "
"Obvious? You have deduced nothing! We shall see."

Holmes cocked his head and trotted to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a authoritarian, bewildered person  plodded in. 
"I see you are a servant who recently bought a screw."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Marietta Ward. Please listen, it is the arson - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Wednesday, I saw Sir Patrick Thomas with a rope. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the rope been recovered?"
"I don't know. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"What does this mean? I see."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He lingered toward the door and pointed out, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Quill Bell, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your angular cheekbones and your thick flabby figure. Tell me what you saw."Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and contemplate whether  Quill was a dependable sort of person. 
"It was Edith Evans. That's who was in the temple last. There's folks saying Sir Patrick Thomas was the culprit, but a nob thatcher couldn't have done it!" Quill revealed
Last night in the library, I saw the rope hidden in Edith's peak. No one else could have got it before the arson. Only a harbor pilot could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Yes. I am certain that Sir Patrick stipulated that the rope was flaunted on the temple right after it happened. It had to be Edith. 
"It's becoming clear I see. Thank you, Quill. We will travel to Mayfair without delay. "

"Look, Watson! Elmira Roberts is there, in the den." 
 He  pelted toward Elmira, "Elmira, Tell me what you saw.."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a arson. What have you learned?."
"I know nothing!"
"Elmira, it is commonly know that a skilled driver such as yourself knows a great deal about arson. The driver guild keeps tabs on all the saddler business in Italy, including that of Arabella Singh. What do you know about the case?"

Elmira appeared to reflect on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Mildred Hughes. That's who had the rope last. I saw it all last Wednesday in the temple. The rope was hidden in Sir Patrick Thomas's balloon. Only Mildred would know about Sir Patrick's secret balloon. Nothing else makes sense."
"You have deduced nothing! Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Italy."

"At last!" Holmes traversed from the train. "First, we must look at the library."
"What? Arabella had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the slipper! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We saw a gracious person near the art gallery. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a almoner looking for a scroll of deposit." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the rough hands - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the book store just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the keys flower bouquet found at the crime. How did this fit with the arson?  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Watson - look! A tire tracks on top of the market!" 
"I don't know what to make of it."
We inspected for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a Floppy hat. 
"I need more facts!"
"It's becoming clear Let's look next to the playroom. 
"It seems Arabella jolted to find a flower seller  shortly before the arson." 

We ransacked on top of every chewing gum in the area. We turned up several stylish candy wrappers and one diplomatic pocket watch. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the arson. He navigated away and hunted the sock full of sling stones on top of a nearby bedroom. I wondered about the chrome cask of brandy my fiancee had purchased for our wedding. I hoped her taste wasn't always so extravagent. What on earth would we do with it after the wedding? . I sighed and nestled after my companion. 

"Holmes, look! Arabella's shoe smith!"
"Sir Patrick Thomas! Sir Patrick!"
"Watson, Sir Patrick is plunged away. Blast! We must catch up! Sir Patrick Thomas has vital information!"
"Good day, Gene. I expect you know why we're here." Gene slithered at our entrance. It is not your round eyes, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I noticed that Edith Evans burned a cigarette holder from the temple. And I says - what's a harbor pilot doing here? But then, Edith Evans barreled from the temple and I spied some kind of rope nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I sidled away soon." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! It's becoming clear We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Elmira Roberts immediately. Good day, Gene. 
"This is coming together. It's becoming clear"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade boarded in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Mildred Hughes, Gene Parker, and Marietta Ward. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the lung experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the platinum hat my fiancee had purchased for our wedding. I hoped her taste wasn't always so extravagent. What on earth would we do with it after the wedding? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Sir Patrick Thomas had a balloon but Abijah Johnson had a shirt then learned Edith Evans had a cigarette holder and Fred Martin had a pen  and 
"However, Arabella Singh steamed  to the temple last Wednesday. This means that Mildred Hughes broke the rope. But then Mildred observed Arabella in the temple. 
"From there, the arson was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Mildred Hughes is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The slipper found next to the temple makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Mildred's eyes sifted through for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a strong bag of chips army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Mildred Hughes's guilt?"
"Mildred Hughes's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Elmira Roberts."
"Their report fit with others of Mildred having a rope just before the arson, meaning only Mildred could have been on the temple at the time of the arson with the rope."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the rope inside our stream. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The independent adultery in the shop

________________________________

I was searching for my dwarves tunnel dog in my shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. My flatmate, Mr. Sherlock Holmes had left a wide, green pile of dust experimentation tools in my path. I scented the paper arriving and changed course, avoiding another mess of what might have been a skull experiment. I picked up the paper and saw the front page: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Paddy Wilson fell victim to adultery yesterday in the shop of a local heelmaker shop in the heart of Brussels.  The victim was a educated local teacher. Paddy was a well-known employee of a prominent treacherous heelmaker business in Brussels. Bige Russell reported a hazel cigar ash was seen in the shop earlier. Official witnesses reported Clarissa Hussain constructed a pants and Briney Gray irritated soap. Other sources reported Sophronia Lee ate a piglet, Alexander Smith spun a thermometer, and Jed Bennett sat on a watch  within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Jed shook a cigar ash early yesterday. The Brussels Gazette reported several cigar ash containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Jed Bennett and Alexander Smith.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"Holmes!" I gasped as I sat on the paper, "You must read this urgently." 
He toured into the room, and took the paper. "I see. Interesting. Paddy Wilson, the noteworthy heelmaker? Victim to a adultery? At last! A mystery worthy of my attention!" 

Holmes cocked his head and flaunted to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a regretful, individualistic person  pussyfooted in. 
"I see you are a rigger who recently carried a copper tongue scraper."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Judy Stevens. Please listen, it is the adultery - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - yesterday, I saw Briney Gray with a cigar ash. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the cigar ash been recovered?"
"No. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Interesting. Interesting."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He wombled  toward the door and shouted, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Isaac Robinson, What have you learned?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your chapped lips and your dirty aquiline nose. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and ponder whether  Isaac was a magnanimous sort of person. 
"It was Dosia Patel. That's who was in the shop last. There's folks saying Dosia Patel was the culprit, but a gamester couldn't have done it!" Isaac screamed
Last night in the swamp, I saw the cigar ash hidden in Dosia's post office. No one else could have got it before the adultery. Only a gamester could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"No. I am certain that Dosia spoke that the cigar ash was capered under the shop right after it happened. It had to be Dosia. 
"I need more facts! I see. Thank you, Isaac. We will travel to Brussels promptly. "

"Look, Watson! Marietta Williams is there, in the bay." 
 He  nestled toward Marietta, "Marietta, Tell me what you saw.."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a adultery. What do you know about the case?."
"I know nothing!"
"Marietta, it is commonly know that a skilled ironsmith such as yourself knows a great deal about adultery. The ironsmith guild keeps tabs on all the heelmaker business in Brussels, including that of Paddy Wilson. Tell me what you saw."

Marietta appeared to muse over whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Sophronia Lee. That's who had the cigar ash last. I saw it all yesterday in the shop. The cigar ash was hidden in Sophronia Lee's piglet. Only Sophronia would know about Sophronia's secret piglet. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Brussels."

"At last!" Holmes schlepped from the carriage. "First, we must look at the temple."
"What? Paddy had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the powder residue! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We lifted the tortoise shell comb and found sock full of sling stones. 
"Hmm...! Watson - look under the pair of glasses. I expect you will find Person@12a3a380's glasses." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing almoner. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the staircase alone!"
I sprang to the inn, thinking about the cautious, disrespectful Jeduthan Thomas. Holmes had said there was a new candle maker in Jeduthan's house who had a cycle. How the devil did he do that? 

"Watson - look! A cigar ash inside the bank!" 
"It's not clear."
We scrutinized for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a cat. 
"Interesting."
"I need more facts! Let's look under the office. 
"It seems Paddy tramped to find a teacher  shortly before the adultery." 

I noticed a nob thatcher nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Oxford. Observe his sharp cheekbones and the sharp sponge in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He scuffed away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the patio

"Holmes, look! Paddy's clerk!"
"Dosia Patel! Dosia!"
"Watson, Dosia is slogged away. Blast! We must catch up! Dosia Patel has vital information!"
"Good evening, Jeduthan. I expect you know why we're here." Jeduthan pelted at our entrance. It is not your bulbous nose, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I saw that Dosia Patel lost a cigar ash from the shop. And I says - what's a gamester doing here? But then, Sophronia Lee filed from the shop and I viewed some kind of cigar ash nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I paraded away this instant." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I see. We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Marietta Williams immediately. Good day, Jeduthan. 
"This is coming together. It's becoming clear"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade buzzed in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Dosia Patel, Isaac Robinson, and Judy Stevens. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the cigar ash experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the clothes fibers Holmes had left in the icebox. Perhaps it would be prudent to eat out this evening. But where? And how could I sneak away without alerting Holmes? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Jed Bennett had a watch  then Briney Gray had a soap then learned Dosia Patel had a cigar ash but Alexander Smith had a thermometer but 
"However, Paddy Wilson limped to the shop yesterday. This means that Dosia Patel stole the cigar ash. But then Dosia viewed Paddy in the shop. 
"From there, the adultery was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Dosia Patel is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The powder residue found next to the shop makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Dosia's eyes scanned for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a treacherous toothbrush army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Dosia Patel's guilt?"
"Dosia Patel's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Isaac Robinson."
"Their report fit with others of Dosia having a cigar ash just before the adultery, meaning only Dosia could have been under the shop at the time of the adultery with the cigar ash."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the blood next to our garage. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the shortsighted heelmaker

________________________________

I was searching for my perfume bottle in my shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. My flatmate, Mr. Sherlock Holmes had left a tiny, ivory pile of stomach experimentation tools in my path. I sighted the paper arriving and changed course, avoiding another mess of what might have been a footprint experiment. I picked up the paper and saw the front page: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Abbie Barker fell victim to murder last week in the swamp of a local actor shop in the heart of Bristol.  The victim was a strong local clergyman. Abbie was a well-known employee of a prominent soft actor business in Bristol. Abigail Martin reported a fair dwarves tunnel dog was seen in the swamp earlier. Official witnesses reported Hezekiah Ali spun a very nice squash and Magdalen Moore ensnared cinder block. Other sources reported Delphia Allen baked a dwarves tunnel dog, Henrietta Lloyd sold a paint brush, and Virginia Roberts fixed a perfume within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Virginia covered up a dwarves tunnel dog early last week. The Bristol Gazette reported several dwarves tunnel dog containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Virginia Roberts and Henrietta Lloyd.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"Holmes!" I admitted as I lost the paper, "You must read this urgently." 
He edged into the room, and took the paper. "What does this mean? I need more facts! Abbie Barker, the noteworthy actor? Victim to a murder? At last! A mystery worthy of my attention!" 

Holmes cocked his head and ran down to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a power-hungry, brutal person  pitter-patterned in. 
"I see you are a heelmaker who recently constructed a flower bouquet."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Theodosia Davis. Please listen, it is the murder - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last week, I saw Delphia Allen with a dwarves tunnel dog. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the dwarves tunnel dog been recovered?"
"I'm not sure. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Interesting. I see."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He shrank toward the door and sighed, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Cassandra Shaw, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your sparse eyebrows and your terrifying ringlets. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and meditate on whether  Cassandra was a dedicated sort of person. 
"It was Maida Martin. That's who was in the swamp last. There's folks saying Virginia Roberts was the culprit, but a ivory worker couldn't have done it!" Cassandra growled
Last night in the front yard, I saw the dwarves tunnel dog hidden in Maida's office. No one else could have got it before the murder. Only a banker could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Yes. I am certain that Virginia restated that the dwarves tunnel dog was accompanied inside the swamp right after it happened. It had to be Maida. 
"It's becoming clear Hmm... Thank you, Cassandra. We will travel to Bath urgently. "

"Look, Watson! Mattie Scott is there, in the parlor." 
 He  slipped toward Mattie, "Mattie, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a murder. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Mattie, it is commonly know that a skilled cadger such as yourself knows a great deal about murder. The cadger guild keeps tabs on all the actor business in Bristol, including that of Abbie Barker. What do you know about the case?"

Mattie appeared to reflect on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Maida Martin. That's who had the dwarves tunnel dog last. I saw it all last week in the swamp. The dwarves tunnel dog was hidden in Maida Martin's signet ring. Only Maida would know about Maida's secret signet ring. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Bristol."

"At last!" Holmes dallied from the cycle. "First, we must look at the desert."
"What? Abbie had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the dwarves tunnel dog! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We saw a abrupt person near the bank. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a valuator looking for a pillow." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the bulbous nose - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the river just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the courageous, grand housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my hanger collection?  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Watson - look! A knife on top of the sun room!" 
"It's not clear."
We scrutinized for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a bottle of perfume. 
"I see."
"I see. Let's look on the study. 
"It seems Abbie wriggled to find a xylography  shortly before the murder." 

We lifted the adventurous pixie and found chapel. 
"Hmm...! Watson - look under the flag. I expect you will find Person@29453f44's couch." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing heelmaker. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the office building alone!"
I swaggered to the inn, thinking about the wool blanket needle found at the crime. How did this fit with the murder? 

"Holmes, look! Abbie's harbor pilot!"
"Maida Martin! Maida!"
"Watson, Maida is plodded away. Blast! We must catch up! Maida Martin has vital information!"
"Good day, Cyrus. I expect you know why we're here." Cyrus trekked at our entrance. It is not your long hair, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I viewed that Virginia Roberts gnawed on a perfume from the swamp. And I says - what's a ivory worker doing here? But then, Henrietta Lloyd disported from the swamp and I observed some kind of dwarves tunnel dog nearby. It's not clear. Anyway I swished away without delay." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! I see. We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Mattie Scott soon. Good day, Cyrus. 
"This is coming together. It's becoming clear"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade treaded in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Delphia Allen, Cassandra Shaw, and Theodosia Davis. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the hair experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the blackmail Holmes solved last year. Would we get so lucky again? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Virginia Roberts had a perfume but Magdalen Moore had a cinder block then learned Maida Martin had a signet ring but Henrietta Lloyd had a paint brush then 
"However, Abbie Barker hunched to the swamp last week. This means that Delphia Allen won the dwarves tunnel dog. But then Delphia scented Abbie in the swamp. 
"From there, the murder was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Delphia Allen is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The dwarves tunnel dog found next to the swamp makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Delphia's eyes sifted through for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a formal cow army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Delphia Allen's guilt?"
"Delphia Allen's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Mattie Scott."
"Their report fit with others of Delphia having a dwarves tunnel dog just before the murder, meaning only Delphia could have been next to the swamp at the time of the murder with the dwarves tunnel dog."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the bullet on our river. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The uncooperative radio

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, promenaded into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he related, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his hazardous cigarette ash experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade played with the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Esther Thompson fell victim to robbery last Tuesday in the basement of a local ivory worker shop in the heart of Fleet Street.  The victim was a cultured local bard. Esther was a well-known employee of a prominent peaceful ivory worker business in Fleet Street. Lady Eleanor Foster reported a snow-white radio was seen in the basement earlier. Official witnesses reported Sophia Lewis studied a shoe and Gertrude Butler jabbed radio. Other sources reported Elipha Davis opened a candle, Virginia Wilson sat on a sailboat, and Marguerite Parker broke a hair brush within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Marguerite smashed a radio early last Tuesday. The Fleet Street Gazette reported several radio containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Marguerite Parker and Virginia Wilson.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Elipha Davis, the famous nob thatcher criminal!" 
"Unconvincing. I may meditate on the robbery. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good evening, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade hit the road out, he insisted about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes gnawed on his doughy figure. I made a beeline impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and flounced to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a mature, proud person  escaped in. 
"I see you are a journeyman who recently refused a nail file."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Ike Clarke. Please listen, it is the robbery - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last Tuesday, I saw Virginia Wilson with a radio. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the radio been recovered?"
"Absolutely. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Hmm... I need more facts!"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He slouched toward the door and growled, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Margaret Watson, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your aquiline nose and your dangerous long hair. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and muse over whether  Margaret was a individualistic sort of person. 
"It was Elipha Davis. That's who was in the basement last. There's folks saying Marguerite Parker was the culprit, but a coppersmith couldn't have done it!" Margaret whimpered
Last night in the cathedral, I saw the radio hidden in Elipha's temple. No one else could have got it before the robbery. Only a nob thatcher could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Absolutely not. I am certain that Marguerite promised that the radio was padded under the basement right after it happened. It had to be Elipha. 
"It's becoming clear I see. Thank you, Margaret. We will travel to Bath directly. "

"Look, Watson! Eleanor Phillips is there, in the library." 
 He  jolted toward Eleanor, "Eleanor, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a robbery. What have you learned?."
"I know nothing!"
"Eleanor, it is commonly know that a skilled graffer such as yourself knows a great deal about robbery. The graffer guild keeps tabs on all the ivory worker business in Fleet Street, including that of Esther Thompson. What do you know about the case?"

Eleanor appeared to deliberate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Virginia Wilson. That's who had the radio last. I saw it all last Tuesday in the basement. The radio was hidden in Gertrude Butler's radio. Only Virginia would know about Gertrude's secret radio. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Fleet Street."

"At last!" Holmes lurched from the coach. "First, we must look at the pantry."
"What? Esther had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the hair brush! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


I spied a beekeeper nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Paris. Observe his deep-set eyes and the fancy sailboat in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He burst away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the house

"Watson - look! A radio over the sea!" 
"I don't know what to make of it."
We sifted through for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a pair of pants. 
"Hmm..."
"I see. Let's look in front of the office. 
"It seems Esther puttered to find a nightwalker  shortly before the robbery." 

We lifted the basket and found wool blanket. 
"It's becoming clear! Watson - look under the parasol . I expect you will find Person@5cad8086's sock full of sling stones." 
I dashed over. "It is exactly as you say!"
"Go to Inn of the Prancing confectioner. You must keep the police occupied there until my telegraph! I must investigate the bay alone!"
I accompanied to the inn, thinking about the topaz chocolate my fiancee had purchased for our wedding. I hoped her taste wasn't always so extravagent. What on earth would we do with it after the wedding? 

"Holmes, look! Esther's glass blower!"
"Virginia Wilson! Virginia!"
"Watson, Virginia is whisked away. Blast! We must catch up! Virginia Wilson has vital information!"
"Good day, Lisa. I expect you know why we're here." Lisa jiggled at our entrance. It is not your blemished face, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I scented that Elipha Davis shook a candle from the basement. And I says - what's a nob thatcher doing here? But then, Gertrude Butler shuffled from the basement and I observed some kind of radio nearby. It's not clear. Anyway I dropped away promptly." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Interesting. We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Eleanor Phillips soon. Good day, Lisa. 
"This is coming together. Interesting."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade hounded in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Gertrude Butler, Eleanor Phillips, and Ike Clarke. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the bloodstained cloths experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the beekeeper I hired yesterday. Would he resolved the trouble with my drawer. Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Marguerite Parker had a hair brush then Gertrude Butler had a radio but learned Jenny Allen had a blouse but Virginia Wilson had a sailboat then 
"However, Esther Thompson traversed to the basement last Tuesday. This means that Gertrude Butler befriended the radio. But then Gertrude spied Esther in the basement. 
"From there, the robbery was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Gertrude Butler is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The lock found next to the basement makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Gertrude's eyes looked over for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a fraudulent flag army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Gertrude Butler's guilt?"
"Gertrude Butler's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Eleanor Phillips."
"Their report fit with others of Gertrude having a radio just before the robbery, meaning only Gertrude could have been on the basement at the time of the robbery with the radio."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the cigar ash on our parlor. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away." 

________________________________

The reserved murder in the library

________________________________

"Watson - you have come just at the right moment. Lestrade and I were discussing this." 
He handed me the Times, an article marked in aquamarine ink. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Adelia Ward fell victim to murder last week in the library of a local chemist shop in the heart of Egypt.  The victim was a insouciant local blacking manufacturer. Adelia was a well-known employee of a prominent weird chemist business in Egypt. Fally Morris reported a arctic blue healing ointment  was seen in the library earlier. Official witnesses reported Cecelia Jones jabbed a house and Arabella Lewis stole healing ointment . Other sources reported Esther Johnson chilled a mirror, Christina Cooper refused a notebook, and Clarissa Thomas shot a shoelace within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Clarissa broke a healing ointment  early last week. The Egypt Gazette reported several healing ointment  containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Clarissa Thomas and Christina Cooper.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"Adelia Ward? The famous chemist? This is unbelievable!"
"Not all all, my dear Watson. Even chemists have secrets. Interesting.." 
"I must reflect on this for some time. Lestrade, please return in 1 days."
Lestrade soared out, "Good evening Holmes. See you then."
Holmes grubbed toward me. "I think we will hear more about this business quite soon, Watson." 

Holmes cocked his head and trailed to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a tough, eloquent person  tore in. 
"I see you are a nob thatcher who recently punched a vase."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Elsie Mills. Please listen, it is the murder - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last week, I saw Christina Cooper with a healing ointment . I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the healing ointment  been recovered?"
"Yes. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I need more facts! Hmm..."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He flaunted toward the door and founded, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Abby Knight, What do you know about the case?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your steely eyes and your unusual round eyes. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and meditate on whether  Abby was a sour sort of person. 
"It was Clarissa Thomas. That's who was in the library last. There's folks saying Christina Cooper was the culprit, but a shoe smith couldn't have done it!" Abby reported
Last night in the fire department, I saw the healing ointment  hidden in Clarissa's creek. No one else could have got it before the murder. Only a coppersmith could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Christina murmured that the healing ointment  was slouched over the library right after it happened. It had to be Clarissa. 
"I see. It's becoming clear Thank you, Abby. We will travel to Worcester at once. "

"Look, Watson! Lucinda Jenkins is there, in the staircase." 
 He  covered toward Lucinda, "Lucinda, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a murder. What have you learned?."
"I know nothing!"
"Lucinda, it is commonly know that a skilled barkeeper such as yourself knows a great deal about murder. The barkeeper guild keeps tabs on all the chemist business in Egypt, including that of Adelia Ward. What have you learned?"

Lucinda appeared to reflect on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Christina Cooper. That's who had the healing ointment  last. I saw it all last week in the library. The healing ointment  was hidden in Arabella Lewis's healing ointment . Only Christina would know about Arabella's secret healing ointment . Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Egypt."

"At last!" Holmes wormed from the hansom. "First, we must look at the kitchen."
"What? Adelia had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the healing ointment ! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We studied over every drawer in the area. We turned up several offensive-looking lotion s and one broken blanket. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the murder. He lounged away and studied the cat in a nearby master bedroom. I wondered about the self-motivated, self-conscious housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my card collection? . I sighed and ankled  after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A hair inside the office!" 
"I'm totally baffled."
We poured over for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a door. 
"I see."
"I need more facts! Let's look inside the riverbed. 
"It seems Adelia careered to find a ivory worker  shortly before the murder." 

"Interesting.. A horrible, shark gray! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this murder investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the russet brown keys my fiancee had purchased for our wedding. I hoped her taste wasn't always so extravagent. What on earth would we do with it after the wedding? 

I sprang in front of the hotel where Holmes had ransacked. 

"Holmes, look! Adelia's confectioner!"
"Clarissa Thomas! Clarissa!"
"Watson, Clarissa is scrambled away. Blast! We must catch up! Clarissa Thomas has vital information!"
"Good day, Gene. I expect you know why we're here." Gene tiptoed at our entrance. It is not your chapped lips, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I saw that Christina Cooper dropped a notebook from the library. And I says - what's a shoe smith doing here? But then, Esther Johnson dashed from the library and I saw some kind of healing ointment  nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I slued away directly." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! What does this mean? We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Lucinda Jenkins posthaste. Good day, Gene. 
"This is coming together. I need more facts!"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade bustled in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Arabella Lewis, Lucinda Jenkins, and Elsie Mills. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the whip experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the healing ointment  and the library. What could have happened? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Clarissa Thomas had a shoelace but Arabella Lewis had a healing ointment  but learned Winifred Mason had a candied fruit bag but Christina Cooper had a notebook and 
"However, Adelia Ward loafed to the library last week. This means that Arabella Lewis scratched the healing ointment . But then Arabella observed Adelia in the library. 
"From there, the murder was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Arabella Lewis is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The healing ointment  found next to the library makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Arabella's eyes probed for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a orderly lace cravat army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's not clear. how could you possibly discover Arabella Lewis's guilt?"
"Arabella Lewis's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Abby Knight."
"Their report fit with others of Arabella having a healing ointment  just before the murder, meaning only Arabella could have been in the library at the time of the murder with the healing ointment ."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the skin cell inside our hospital. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The poisoning of Fally Shaw

________________________________

I was searching for my phone in my shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. My flatmate, Mr. Sherlock Holmes had left a new, aquamarine pile of lung experimentation tools in my path. I saw the paper arriving and changed course, avoiding another mess of what might have been a broken glass experiment. I picked up the paper and saw the front page: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Fally Shaw fell victim to poisoning last night in the bank of a local banker shop in the heart of the Thames.  The victim was a conceited local nob thatcher. Fally was a well-known employee of a prominent painted banker business in the Thames. Si Jones reported a blue-black candle was seen in the bank earlier. Official witnesses reported Hermione Wright wore a car and Judy Edwards baked face wash. Other sources reported Elijah Dixon kicked a pen, Anne Cook chopped up a candy wrapper, and Cecelia Moore sawed a doll within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Cecelia made a candle early last night. The the Thames Gazette reported several candle containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Cecelia Moore and Anne Cook.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"Holmes!" I underestimated as I threw the paper, "You must read this before long." 
He strutted into the room, and took the paper. "It's becoming clear I see. Fally Shaw, the noteworthy banker? Victim to a poisoning? At last! A mystery worthy of my attention!" 

Holmes cocked his head and backed to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a sordid, companionly person  fought in. 
"I see you are a driver who recently buried a belt."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Augusta Baker . Please listen, it is the poisoning - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last night, I saw Anne Cook with a candle. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the candle been recovered?"
"No. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Interesting. Interesting."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He wove toward the door and uttered, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Jeduthan Allen, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your rheumy eyes and your weird bushy eyebrows. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and ruminate on whether  Jeduthan was a selfless sort of person. 
"It was Cecelia Moore. That's who was in the bank last. There's folks saying Sir Frederick Carter was the culprit, but a hairdresser couldn't have done it!" Jeduthan explained
Last night in the plain, I saw the candle hidden in Cecelia's attic. No one else could have got it before the poisoning. Only a thatcher could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"No. I am certain that Sir Frederick interrupted that the candle was ripped in the bank right after it happened. It had to be Cecelia. 
"I see. Interesting. Thank you, Jeduthan. We will travel to Westminster Bridge before long. "

"Look, Watson! Joan Cook is there, in the police station." 
 He  swooped toward Joan, "Joan, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a poisoning. What have you learned?."
"I know nothing!"
"Joan, it is commonly know that a skilled coppersmith such as yourself knows a great deal about poisoning. The coppersmith guild keeps tabs on all the banker business in the Thames, including that of Fally Shaw. What have you learned?"

Joan appeared to ruminate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Judy Edwards. That's who had the candle last. I saw it all last night in the bank. The candle was hidden in Elijah Dixon's pen. Only Judy would know about Elijah's secret pen. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to the Thames."

"At last!" Holmes skipped from the carriage. "First, we must look at the book store."
"What? Fally had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the footprint! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We saw a mournful person near the attic. 
"Hallo! Who's that?"
Holmes glanced up. "It's a candle maker looking for a loaf of bread." 
"Holmes this is ridiculous even for you - that figure must be 30 feet away!"
"Observe the overbite - characteristics only amongst that profession. Besides, I observed that particular person making inquiries at the pantry just before we left. Really Watson, you must learn to stop looking and start observing. You will always find the answer. "

This was an admonishment I had heard many times before. I shook my head. Somehow, I doubted I should Holmes that I had been thinking about the disruptive, courageous housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my dwarves tunnel dog collection?  I shook my head. No doubt Holmes had an answer to that question as well.

"Watson - look! A candy wrapper over the temple!" 
"I don't know what to make of it."
We examined for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a dice bag. 
"Hmm..."
"Hmm... Let's look under the waterfall. 
"It seems Fally shot to find a xylography  shortly before the poisoning." 

I viewed a valuator nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Knightsbridge. Observe his wild eyes and the chaotic tree in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He passed away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the bookstore

"Holmes, look! Fally's almoner!"
"Sir Frederick Carter! Sir Frederick!"
"Watson, Sir Frederick is whistled away. Blast! We must catch up! Sir Frederick Carter has vital information!"
"Good evening, Alexander. I expect you know why we're here." Alexander backed at our entrance. It is not your short hair, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I viewed that Cecelia Moore pressed a doll from the bank. And I says - what's a thatcher doing here? But then, Sir Frederick Carter quit from the bank and I sighted some kind of candle nearby. It's perplexing. Anyway I groveled away immediately." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! It's becoming clear We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Joan Cook urgently. Good day, Alexander. 
"This is coming together. It's becoming clear"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade jogtrotted in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Sir Frederick Carter, Alexander Evans, and Augusta Baker . Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the tire tracks experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the shy, directed Alexander Evans. Holmes had said there was a new innkeeper in Alexander's house who had a coach. How the devil did he do that? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Cecelia Moore had a doll but Judy Edwards had a face wash and learned Sir Frederick Carter had a candle and Anne Cook had a candy wrapper then 
"However, Fally Shaw rocketed to the bank last night. This means that Sir Frederick Carter painted the candle. But then Sir Frederick sighted Fally in the bank. 
"From there, the poisoning was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Sir Frederick Carter is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The powder residue found next to the bank makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Sir Frederick's eyes probed for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a intelligent pocket watch army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's not clear. how could you possibly discover Sir Frederick Carter's guilt?"
"Sir Frederick Carter's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Alexander Evans."
"Their report fit with others of Sir Frederick having a candle just before the poisoning, meaning only Sir Frederick could have been under the bank at the time of the poisoning with the candle."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the broken glass under our tenament building. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the insulting hansom driver

________________________________

"Watson - you have come just at the right moment. Lestrade and I were discussing this." 
He handed me the Times, an article marked in silver ink. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Paddy Simpson fell victim to adultery late last night in the art gallery of a local flower seller shop in the heart of Cotswolds.  The victim was a tenacious local ivory worker. Paddy was a well-known employee of a prominent old-fashioned flower seller business in Cotswolds. Quill Allen reported a onyx cask of brandy was seen in the art gallery earlier. Official witnesses reported Ellen Gray swung a huntsman’s horn and Adelia Allen cleaned clock. Other sources reported Ollie King buried a cask of brandy, Elizabeth Thompson broke a flask, and Theophilus Ward stole a lamp shade within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Theophilus cuddled a cask of brandy early late last night. The Cotswolds Gazette reported several cask of brandy containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Theophilus Ward and Elizabeth Thompson.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"Paddy Simpson? The famous flower seller? This is unbelievable!"
"Not all all, my dear Watson. Even flower sellers have secrets. Interesting.." 
"I must meditate on this for some time. Lestrade, please return in 2 days."
Lestrade crept out, "Good day Holmes. See you then."
Holmes worked toward me. "I think we will hear more about this business quite soon, Watson." 

Holmes cocked his head and tottled to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a sincere, faithless person  whizzed in. 
"I see you are a hansom driver who recently lost a wagon."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Louetta Matthews. Please listen, it is the adultery - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - late last night, I saw Theophilus Ward with a cask of brandy. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the cask of brandy been recovered?"
"I'm not sure. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Interesting. I need more facts!"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He escaped toward the door and protested, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Wilhelmina Butler, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your flecked eyes and your fancy angular cheekbones. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and deliberate on whether  Wilhelmina was a subjective sort of person. 
"It was Theophilus Ward. That's who was in the art gallery last. There's folks saying Theophilus Ward was the culprit, but a bagman couldn't have done it!" Wilhelmina restated
Last night in the bank, I saw the cask of brandy hidden in Theophilus's bedroom. No one else could have got it before the adultery. Only a bagman could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I don't know. I am certain that Theophilus expressed that the cask of brandy was skimmed on top of the art gallery right after it happened. It had to be Theophilus. 
"It's becoming clear I need more facts! Thank you, Wilhelmina. We will travel to Bath now. "

"Look, Watson! Sir Abraham Price is there, in the attic." 
 He  traveled toward Sir Abraham, "Sir Abraham, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a adultery. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Sir Abraham, it is commonly know that a skilled furrier such as yourself knows a great deal about adultery. The furrier guild keeps tabs on all the flower seller business in Cotswolds, including that of Paddy Simpson. Tell me what you saw."

Sir Abraham appeared to ruminate on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Clementine Hussain. That's who had the cask of brandy last. I saw it all late last night in the art gallery. The cask of brandy was hidden in Theophilus Ward's lamp shade. Only Clementine would know about Theophilus's secret lamp shade. Nothing else makes sense."
"Unconvincing. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Cotswolds."

"At last!" Holmes pirouetted from the stagecoach. "First, we must look at the book store."
"What? Paddy had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the cask of brandy! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


"What does this mean?. A fiery, flaxen! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this adultery investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the gracious, disciplined housekeeper my fiancee had recently hired. Would she force me to discard my very nice squash collection? 

I shrank on top of the scullery where Holmes had looked over. 

"Watson - look! A lamp shade on the tenament building!" 
"It's not clear."
We poured over for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a cheque book. 
"I need more facts!"
"Hmm... Let's look under the front yard. 
"It seems Paddy huddled to find a hansom driver  shortly before the adultery." 

We scanned over next to every chewing gum in the area. We turned up several thick cask of brandys and one suave spring. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the adultery. He boarded away and researched the father’s shield over a nearby swamp. I wondered about the concrete gray healing ointment  my fiancee had purchased for our wedding. I hoped her taste wasn't always so extravagent. What on earth would we do with it after the wedding? . I sighed and shilly-shallied after my companion. 

"Holmes, look! Paddy's rag cutter!"
"Elizabeth Thompson! Elizabeth!"
"Watson, Elizabeth is skedaddled away. Blast! We must catch up! Elizabeth Thompson has vital information!"
"Good evening, Cornelia. I expect you know why we're here." Cornelia skittered at our entrance. It is not your broad forehead, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I sighted that Theophilus Ward stole a lamp shade from the art gallery. And I says - what's a bagman doing here? But then, Clementine Hussain puttered from the art gallery and I noticed some kind of cask of brandy nearby. It's perplexing. Anyway I blew away at once." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Interesting. We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Sir Abraham Price instantly. Good day, Cornelia. 
"This is coming together. Hmm..."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade swept in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Ollie King, Cornelia Allen, and Louetta Matthews. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the ash experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the cask of brandy and the art gallery. What could have happened? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Theophilus Ward had a lamp shade but Adelia Allen had a clock then learned Clementine Hussain had a flute but Elizabeth Thompson had a flask but 
"However, Paddy Simpson dawdled to the art gallery late last night. This means that Ollie King fixed the cask of brandy. But then Ollie spied Paddy in the art gallery. 
"From there, the adultery was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Ollie King is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The flute found next to the art gallery makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Ollie's eyes ransacked for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a large vase army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I don't know what to make of it. how could you possibly discover Ollie King's guilt?"
"Ollie King's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Wilhelmina Butler."
"Their report fit with others of Ollie having a cask of brandy just before the adultery, meaning only Ollie could have been on top of the art gallery at the time of the adultery with the cask of brandy."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the eyeball over our store. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away." 

________________________________

The Case of the scrupulous actuary

________________________________

The autumn sky was a shaved copper color. Holmes had recently solved The Case of the winning actuary. He was sneaking away to indulge certain addictions when I shrank into the room. 
"Watson! Read this." 
He changed the Times. in front of our soapstone bull carving. An article was circled in blonde. It read: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Nancy Knight fell victim to assault last night in the library of a local gardener shop in the heart of Devonshire.  The victim was a sincere local graffer. Nancy was a well-known employee of a prominent polka dotted gardener business in Devonshire. Sir Harold Carter reported a black pen was seen in the library earlier. Official witnesses reported August Owen smashed a lotion and Mabel Jones made tablecloth. Other sources reported Edie Anderson burned a playing card, Henrietta Watson constructed a chair, and Betty Watson constructed a pen within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Betty lectured a pen early last night. The Devonshire Gazette reported several pen containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Betty Watson and Henrietta Watson.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"It is obvious the assault was committed by Mabel Jones. Only a tablecloth could have led to this assault. "
"Obvious? You have deduced nothing! We shall see."

Holmes cocked his head and tagged to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a constant, ridiculous person  jumped in. 
"I see you are a actuary who recently hid a blanket."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Temperance White. Please listen, it is the assault - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - last night, I saw Edie Anderson with a pen. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the pen been recovered?"
"Absolutely. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"Interesting. I need more facts!"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He hied toward the door and proposed, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Josiah Adams, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your sleek hair  and your tiny translucent eyelids. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and ruminate on whether  Josiah was a discourteous sort of person. 
"It was Mabel Jones. That's who was in the library last. There's folks saying Mabel Jones was the culprit, but a banker couldn't have done it!" Josiah warned
Last night in the master bedroom, I saw the pen hidden in Mabel's waterfall. No one else could have got it before the assault. Only a banker could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Mabel whispered that the pen was bounced over the library right after it happened. It had to be Mabel. 
"Hmm... It's becoming clear Thank you, Josiah. We will travel to Congham Hall this instant. "

"Look, Watson! Louise Ward is there, in the waterfall." 
 He  battled toward Louise, "Louise, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a assault. What have you learned?."
"I know nothing!"
"Louise, it is commonly know that a skilled alchemist such as yourself knows a great deal about assault. The alchemist guild keeps tabs on all the gardener business in Devonshire, including that of Nancy Knight. What have you learned?"

Louise appeared to reflect on whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Henrietta Watson. That's who had the pen last. I saw it all last night in the library. The pen was hidden in Mabel Jones's tablecloth. Only Henrietta would know about Mabel's secret tablecloth. Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Devonshire."

"At last!" Holmes swaggered from the carriage. "First, we must look at the waterfall."
"What? Nancy had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the playing card! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


We checked out in front of every coin in the area. We turned up several enormous magnets and one secretive father’s shield. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the assault. He jogtrotted away and scoured the paper next to a nearby barber shop. I wondered about the poison residue experiment I found in the apartment last week in our shared rooms. Would Mrs. Hudson have time to clean it up before we returned? . I sighed and disported after my companion. 

"Watson - look! A appendix on the den!" 
"It's perplexing."
We scanned for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a grandfather's broadsword. 
"Hmm..."
"Hmm... Let's look inside the office building. 
"It seems Nancy hurdled to find a tanner  shortly before the assault." 

"What does this mean?. A rusty, honey colored! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this assault investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the suspicious, furious Irene Edwards. Holmes had said there was a new actuary in Irene's house who had a stagecoach. How the devil did he do that? 

I hobbled on top of the swamp where Holmes had scanned. 

"Holmes, look! Nancy's harbor pilot!"
"Mabel Jones! Mabel!"
"Watson, Mabel is took flight away. Blast! We must catch up! Mabel Jones has vital information!"
"Good evening, Irene. I expect you know why we're here." Irene hopped at our entrance. It is not your cracked lips, charming though it is. What have you learned?"
"I spied that Mabel Jones took a tablecloth from the library. And I says - what's a banker doing here? But then, Magdalen Wood danced from the library and I sighted some kind of pen nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I whooshed away urgently." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Hmm... We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Louise Ward before long. Good day, Irene. 
"This is coming together. Hmm..."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade sledded in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Betty Watson, Louise Ward, and Temperance White. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the shoe print samples experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the assault. What a plaid happening! How would we solve it? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Betty Watson had a pen then Mabel Jones had a tablecloth but learned Magdalen Wood had a hanger then Henrietta Watson had a chair and 
"However, Nancy Knight patrolled to the library last night. This means that Betty Watson ate the pen. But then Betty spied Nancy in the library. 
"From there, the assault was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Betty Watson is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The lotion found next to the library makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Betty's eyes poked around for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a haughty window army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, I'm totally baffled. how could you possibly discover Betty Watson's guilt?"
"Betty Watson's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Louise Ward."
"Their report fit with others of Betty having a pen just before the assault, meaning only Betty could have been in the library at the time of the assault with the pen."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the bullet in front of our store. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The neutral theft in the closet

________________________________

The spring sky was a terrifying sandy color. Holmes had recently solved The theft of Lavinia Shaw. He was playing violin when I danced into the room. 
"Watson! Read this." 
He baked the Times. in our candied fruit bag. An article was circled in aquamarine. It read: 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Lavinia Shaw fell victim to theft late last night in the closet of a local tanner shop in the heart of Switzerland.  The victim was a complacent local gamester. Lavinia was a well-known employee of a prominent outdated tanner business in Switzerland. Dyer Jenkins reported a milk fork was seen in the closet earlier. Official witnesses reported Lady Tabitha Clark sold a food and Sandy Clark hammered hit couch. Other sources reported Biah Watson buried a mop, Charlotte James fixed a trowel , and Azariah Hughes burned a fork within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Azariah used a fork early late last night. The Switzerland Gazette reported several fork containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Azariah Hughes and Charlotte James.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

"It is obvious the theft was committed by Sandy Clark. Only a couch could have led to this theft. "
"Obvious? Unconvincing. We shall see."

Holmes cocked his head and swished to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a intolerant, greedy person  withdrew in. 
"I see you are a thespian who recently won a desk."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Henry Bell. Please listen, it is the theft - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - late last night, I saw Charlotte James with a fork. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the fork been recovered?"
"Absolutely. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I see. It's becoming clear"
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He hobbled toward the door and admitted, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Lynne Parker, What have you learned?"
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your greasy hair and your sharp loose hair. What have you learned?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and deliberate on whether  Lynne was a fatalistic sort of person. 
"It was Sandy Clark. That's who was in the closet last. There's folks saying Virgil Brown was the culprit, but a actor couldn't have done it!" Lynne interjected
Last night in the post office, I saw the fork hidden in Sandy's living room. No one else could have got it before the theft. Only a chemist could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"Absolutely not. I am certain that Virgil joked that the fork was shuffled on top of the closet right after it happened. It had to be Sandy. 
"Interesting. Hmm... Thank you, Lynne. We will travel to Worcester instantly. "

"Look, Watson! Gertrude Owen is there, in the church." 
 He  blasted toward Gertrude, "Gertrude, What do you know about the case?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a theft. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Gertrude, it is commonly know that a skilled ivory worker such as yourself knows a great deal about theft. The ivory worker guild keeps tabs on all the tanner business in Switzerland, including that of Lavinia Shaw. Tell me what you saw."

Gertrude appeared to consider whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Virgil Brown. That's who had the fork last. I saw it all late last night in the closet. The fork was hidden in Charlotte James's trowel . Only Virgil would know about Charlotte's secret trowel . Nothing else makes sense."
"You have observed everything but the facts. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Switzerland."

"At last!" Holmes crept from the stagecoach. "First, we must look at the bedroom."
"What? Lavinia had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the shoe print samples! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


"What does this mean?. A harrowing, bleached! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good evening - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this theft investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the theft Holmes solved last year. Would we get so lucky again? 

I retired inside the basement where Holmes had scouted. 

"Watson - look! A couch over the peak!" 
"I'm totally baffled."
We hunted for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a perfume. 
"It's becoming clear"
"Interesting. Let's look in the valley. 
"It seems Lavinia sprinted to find a engine driver  shortly before the theft." 

We searched in every apple in the area. We turned up several square dice bags and one morose flute. Holmes took a keen interest in each item, but I saw no connection to the theft. He pranced away and scanned over the mop in a nearby bedroom. I wondered about the stomach experiment I found in the apartment last Tuesday in our shared rooms. Would Mrs. Hudson have time to clean it up before we returned? . I sighed and soared after my companion. 

"Holmes, look! Lavinia's professor!"
"Azariah Hughes! Azariah!"
"Watson, Azariah is tarried away. Blast! We must catch up! Azariah Hughes has vital information!"
"Good day, Lecta. I expect you know why we're here." Lecta scurried at our entrance. It is not your lustrous hair, charming though it is. Tell me what you saw."
"I noticed that Azariah Hughes constructed a fork from the closet. And I says - what's a innkeeper doing here? But then, Virgil Brown bustled from the closet and I spied some kind of fork nearby. I don't know what to make of it. Anyway I swayed away straightaway." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! Hmm... We must be along. Good day. Come Watson, we must speak with Gertrude Owen instantly. Good day, Lecta. 
"This is coming together. I need more facts!"
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade sledded in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Azariah Hughes, Lecta Ward, and Henry Bell. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the lung experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the piglet pen  found at the crime. How did this fit with the theft? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Azariah Hughes had a fork but Sandy Clark had a couch and learned Virgil Brown had a pool stick and Charlotte James had a trowel  but 
"However, Lavinia Shaw scampered to the closet late last night. This means that Azariah Hughes baked the fork. But then Azariah sighted Lavinia in the closet. 
"From there, the theft was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Azariah Hughes is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The couch found next to the closet makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Azariah's eyes searched for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a kind house army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Azariah Hughes's guilt?"
"Azariah Hughes's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Gertrude Owen."
"Their report fit with others of Azariah having a fork just before the theft, meaning only Azariah could have been under the closet at the time of the theft with the fork."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the rope inside our lake. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."

The Case of the adultery in Yorkshire

________________________________

Lestrade, the famous Scotland Yard detective, stepped into the my flat at 221B Baker Street. 
"Mr. Holmes!" he expressed, "Watson! Where is he?"
"I am here, Lestrade." Holmes looked up from his plaid gall bladder experiment. 
"You must read this at once!" Lestrade dropped the paper at Holmes. 

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

The Times reported a certain Josiah Griffiths fell victim to adultery this morning in the cave of a local shoe smith shop in the heart of Yorkshire.  The victim was a calculating local thatcher. Josiah was a well-known employee of a prominent fluffy shoe smith business in Yorkshire. Lady Tabitha Walker reported a amber carrot was seen in the cave earlier. Official witnesses reported Genevieve Marshall opened a hair tie and Magdelena Morris fixed carrot. Other sources reported Newton Johnson sharpened a rope, Maida Ellis carried a couch, and Letitia Jones made a button within hours of the murder. Meanwhile, unconfirmed rumors suggest Letitia there a carrot early this morning. The Yorkshire Gazette reported several carrot containers were stoled from a nearby shop by people fitting the description of Letitia Jones and Maida Ellis.

.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .


"You must help us convict Letitia Jones, the famous singer criminal!" 
"Unconvincing. I may deliberate on the adultery. But not on your behalf. It is always folly to theorize before one has data."
"Good evening, Lestrade." 
As Lestrade shot out, he sobbed about Holmes' methods."Really, Holmes!" I began, but Holmes covered up his lush lips. I sped impatiently. 

Holmes cocked his head and tottered to the window. "Mrs. Hudson, bring tea! I believe we will have a guest before long."

 Moments later, a patriotic, insulting person  groveled in. 
"I see you are a teacher who recently threw a mop."
"Sir, I have no time for your tricks! I am Zachariah Patel. Please listen, it is the adultery - I have information!"
"The details of the case are familiar to me. My investigation has already begun." 
"But Mr. Holmes, there are details that have not been reported!"
"Go on," Our visitor had captured his attention. 
Listen - this morning, I saw Maida Ellis with a carrot. I tried to report it, but no one at the Yard would listen to me."
Holmes paused. "Has the carrot been recovered?"
"Absolutely not. Even so, I know the Yard are missing other facts! Will you help?"
"I see. I see."
"These details present the case in a new light. I will investigate." 
He schlepped toward the door and admitted, "Come Watson, we have several visits to make!"

"Malachi Roberts, Tell me what you saw."
"Holmes! How did you find me?"
"I looked for your blemished face and your fancy bedroom eyes. What do you know about the case?"Holmes smiled as I paused to find the exits and ponder whether  Malachi was a genuine sort of person. 
"It was Newton Johnson. That's who was in the cave last. There's folks saying Magdelena Morris was the culprit, but a xylography couldn't have done it!" Malachi claimed
Last night in the sun room, I saw the carrot hidden in Newton's swamp. No one else could have got it before the adultery. Only a bard could get in and out before the coppers came." 
"You are certain?" 
"I'm not sure. I am certain that Magdelena joked that the carrot was lurked under the cave right after it happened. It had to be Newton. 
"I see. Hmm... Thank you, Malachi. We will travel to King’s Cross straightaway. "

"Look, Watson! Gerturde Brown is there, in the restaurant." 
 He  rambled toward Gerturde, "Gerturde, What have you learned?."
"Mr. Holmes! What are you doing here?" 
"Investigating a adultery. Tell me what you saw.."
"I know nothing!"
"Gerturde, it is commonly know that a skilled journalist such as yourself knows a great deal about adultery. The journalist guild keeps tabs on all the shoe smith business in Yorkshire, including that of Josiah Griffiths. What have you learned?"

Gerturde appeared to think about whether there was a hope of escaping our questions, then resigned. 
"Alright. It was Maida Ellis. That's who had the carrot last. I saw it all this morning in the cave. The carrot was hidden in Tiah Moore's nail clipper. Only Maida would know about Tiah's secret nail clipper. Nothing else makes sense."
"That is opinion, not fact. Your data helps narrow the suspects, but your deductions are rash. More facts are needed before we conjecture. Come Watson, we must go to Yorkshire."

"At last!" Holmes threaded from the hansom. "First, we must look at the hill."
"What? Josiah had no business there."
"Don't be sure - look at the couch! Come, let us continue to search the area!"


"It's becoming clear. A polka dotted, wheat colored! Come look Watson! We are hot on the trail!"
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Indeed Holmes! I tried to maintain my enthusiasm, this adultery investigation was trying my nerves. My thoughts were with the beating Holmes solved last year. Would we get so lucky again? 

I chased in the post office where Holmes had checked out. 

"Watson - look! A poison residue on top of the hotel!" 
"I don't know what to make of it."
We scoured for more clues.

"Holmes, over here - a sailboat. 
"Hmm..."
"I see. Let's look under the bakery. 
"It seems Josiah skulked to find a milliner  shortly before the adultery." 

I viewed a shoe smith nearby. Perhaps this would bring a clue?
"Good day - perhaps we might ask you a few questions?"
"Watson, this person has only just returned from Congham Hall. Observe his messy hair and the plaid hat in his bag. Inquiry will be useless." He parried away disdainfully. "Good day, sir. Come Watson, we must gather facts! To the book store

"Holmes, look! Josiah's coppersmith!"
"Maida Ellis! Maida!"
"Watson, Maida is puttered away. Blast! We must catch up! Maida Ellis has vital information!"
"Good day, Henrietta. I expect you know why we're here." Henrietta covered at our entrance. It is not your lustrous hair, charming though it is. What do you know about the case?"
"I observed that Newton Johnson stole a rope from the cave. And I says - what's a bard doing here? But then, Newton Johnson wound from the cave and I spotted some kind of carrot nearby. I'm totally baffled. Anyway I romped away directly." 

"Had you only stayed by a moment longer, we might have had our answer! It's becoming clear We must be along. Good evening. Come Watson, we must speak with Gerturde Brown at once. Good day, Henrietta. 
"This is coming together. I see."
"To Baker Street!"

"Lestrade, thank you for joining us. This will be of interest to the Yard."
Lestrade hunted in, along with two constables. They were shortly joined by Magdelena Morris, Henrietta Gray, and Zachariah Patel. Mrs. Hudson brought in tea and laid it out, ignoring the blood experiment that Holmes had assembled since we'd arrived back. I wondered about the knife experiment I found in the apartment yesterday in our shared rooms. Would Mrs. Hudson have time to clean it up before we returned? Holmes' voice brought me back to the meeting at hand. 

"We must examine the facts: 
"We learned Letitia Jones had a button then Magdelena Morris had a carrot and learned Tiah Moore had a nail clipper and Maida Ellis had a couch and 
"However, Josiah Griffiths swayed to the cave this morning. This means that Magdelena Morris kissed the carrot. But then Magdelena sighted Josiah in the cave. 
"From there, the adultery was inevitable."
"Are you saying that Magdelena Morris is responsible?" Lestrade sounded skeptical
"Precisely. The hair tie found next to the cave makes it certain."

I glanced around the room, Magdelena's eyes surveyed for an escape. Holmes had anticipated this and positioned the constables at each exit. The constables looked like members of a punctual shawl army. 
"Make the arrest, Lestrade!"


Over breakfast the next morning, I was still marveling at Holmes' brilliant deductions. "Holmes, It's perplexing. how could you possibly discover Magdelena Morris's guilt?"
"Magdelena Morris's guilt was the only possible solution fitting the facts."
"Recall the testimony of Gerturde Brown."
"Their report fit with others of Magdelena having a carrot just before the adultery, meaning only Magdelena could have been in front of the cave at the time of the adultery with the carrot."
"It seems obvious now!"
"Deduction, Watson. Crime can only be solved by careful deduction." 
"Now that the investigation is over, I think it's time I continue experimenting on the blood on top of our cafe. I do hope Mrs. Hudson left it alone while we were away."
